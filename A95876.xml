            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

                  <pb n="4" facs="tcp:150341:7"/> When the time appointed came, these two were espoused in all honour fitting for their Estates, and largness shewed it self on every side. This Marriage Feast endured long, but at last being ended, the Emperour (assisted with all his worthy Train) made preparation to take their leave of King <hi>Pepin</hi> his Brother in Law, and take their way towards <hi>Constantinople,</hi> with his fair Empress <hi>Bellysant.</hi> Being thus all mounted on Horse-back, King <hi>Pepin</hi> also set forward with his Brother Emperor, to bring him on his way, Royally attended on every side, with Lords, Ladies, and many other Gallants of the Court: And they that could not find legs to go, found eyes to weep for the departure of their fair Lady and Mistress, the new Empress of <hi>Constantino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>At last, both these mighty Princes came neer unto a Port of the Sea, whereat they must needs part; there taking leave of each other, they were forced to render more thanks in tears, then words, the which I am not able to express: But above all, the Emperor yielded King <hi>Pepin</hi> worthy thanks for his quick, sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, and generous consent, in giving to him his fair Sister <hi>Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lysant,</hi> and with so frank and free a heart to yield him his good will. At which words of the Emperour, unto King <hi>Pepin,</hi> the King presently embraced him in his arms; saying, Fair Sir, and my right loving Lord and Brother, I have not received you ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording as your State required, nor with such Triumphs and Magnificence as became me, but in that you have so graciously accepted my small power, I hold my self content in that I have done, but not that I should have done: and therefore there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longeth small thanks to me, but from me innumerable, in that you have been pleased to accept of my Sister for your wife; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by (I trust) long friendship shall be continued betwixt us; In token whereof, I take witness of all that are here present, that my Body, my Realm, my Goods, and all the powers that I can raise in <hi>France,</hi> to adventure for your safety and succour, all the days of my life.</p>
               <p>King <hi>Pepin</hi> being now departed from the Emperor, turned himself to his Sister <hi>Bellysant,</hi> and in this manner takes his leave: Fair Sister (quoth he) think no longer of this Countrey
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:150341:7"/> of <hi>France,</hi> wherein you have spent your infant days, but remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber that you are removed to a Country of better conditions. Also let your behaviour be such, that I, the rest of your Friends, and the whole company of all the Peers, may have honour and joy in you.</p>
               <p>Again, as the Country where you now do go is strange unto you, so be you governed by the modest Ladies of the Land, and give no ear to wicked counsel, or to such as would move you to disloyalty; For you are the Creature that I have always dearest loved in all the world; wherefore, if I should hear tydings other then good from you, or of you, it would be the only cause to take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way my life. After this he gave unto his Sister many worthy gifts, and so embracing and kissing her, with weeping eyes, he left her to the mercy of the Waves. The young Lady, whose heart being overcharged betwixt joy and fear, was not able to answer a word, and what with tears, and sighs, the passage of her tongue was utterly stopt. Then all the Lords and Ladies took their leave each of other, at which was let fall many a brinish tear, as well on their parts of <hi>France,</hi> as they also that were to go for <hi>Constantinople,</hi> but especially for the departure of the fair Lady <hi>Bellysant.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>All duties of love being ended, King <hi>Pepin</hi> returned into <hi>France,</hi> and the Emperor by this time mounted on the Seas, had wind and water at such will and pleasure, that within short space, he with all his Train arrived with safety at <hi>Constantinople:</hi> where at their landing they were all received with great Ioy, Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, and Triumph; all which, here were needless to recount. But mark what hapned; not long after these joys and Triumphs were clean extinguished, that were made for the Lady <hi>Bellysant,</hi> in place thereof, nothing but mournings, lamentations, and tears were placed, and all for the said poor Lady, which by treason and false accusations, was cast out and banished, as hereafter more at large you shall perceive.</p>

               <head>CHAP. II. How the Arch-priest of Constantinople betrayed the Emperor his Lord and Master in making love to fair Bellysant the Empress, and what evil followed thereupon.</head>
               <p>IN <hi>Constantinople</hi> lived an Arch-Priest, in whom the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror put such trust, and loved so fervently, that he bestowed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him great Riches and Possessions, and committed all his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>som-thoughts unto his Secrecy: And in the end made him sole Governour and Commander over all his house; as also, he was the Emperors Principal Confessor, and one of his greatest Counsellors, for the which, he afterwards had many a sorrowful heart.</p>
               <p>This Bishop, forgetting all the Emperors favours, and great honours done unto him, being intangled and overcome with the beauty of the new Empress, which excelled all mortal creatures, inordinate lust prevailed with him so far, that there was nothing stood in his way, save only fit time and opportunity, to settle this his determination. At last it chanced on a day, that he espyed her all alone, sitting solitarily in her Chamber, which this Arch-Priest well observing, he came into the Chamber likewise, and sat down by her: At last he began to behold her with a smiling and jesting countenace, of all which (the Lady mistrusted nothing) for that she very well remembred his greatness with the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror, and his familiarity in the house, and she never so much as once dreaming or thinking such an evil thought, as that he there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by would colour so foul and filthy an Act, as to motion her to disho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, especially towards the Emperor his worthy Lord and Master, who so dearly esteemed of him, and so much affected him: But there is never more danger like to ensue, then when one of the same house intendeth Treason. But at the last, after many gestures of impurity, and sitting still by this worthy and vertuous Lady, he began to utter his lacivious thoughts on this manner.</p>
               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:150341:8"/>
               <p>Right dear and Soveraign Lady (quoth he) I am your Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant and Chaplain; therefore I beseech you not to stop your ears, but rather set them wide open to hear my rude words; especially, for that I am burnt up in affection towards your fair person, and for whose love I have suffered intollerable torments in my fiery bosom. Know therefore (my redoubted Lady) that the beauty of your admirable person, and the supernal form wherein you are framed and composed, hath even ravished my Spirits, broken my heart, split my whole sences in sunder, and quite bereft me of all rest, both by night and day, and onely with doting upon your peerless beauty. Again (fair Lady) my Meat, Drink, Manners, yea, and my very conutenance, they all plead at the Bar of your fair face, and respendent Countenance; Insomuch, that onely my request, and prayers unto the Gods, is even this, that they would so inchant that heart of yours, that you would at length give consent unto me your vassal, that I might not onely serve you, but also delight you in all those pleasures you are ordained unto. If, Lady, you refuse me, and cast me off, denying these my unrestless thoughts (than which nothing will sooner cut my heart in sunder) I can look for nothing but present death, and ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther covet therein to be locked fast, as in a Prison, than receive a denial from those your fair lips. Alas! (fair Lady) you are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowned in all the gifts of Nature: Fair, Amiable, Courteous, Gentle, and also Youthful, be not then the cause that I should determine my life, by losing your love, but rather grant what I desire, and thereby make me for ever yours in hearty affection. But, Lady, happily you will urge, how dare you to offend the Gods in this unlawful act? To this, fair Lady, I answer, I am one of the Vicars of the Gods upon earth, and therefore it wholly rests in my power, to absolve you from your sins, and injoyn you Penance; which trust me Lady, shall fall out to be but very ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie, so you grant me love.</p>

<pb n="8" facs="tcp:150341:9"/> thereon may ensue? First, as I said, against the sacred order; se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, but most principally, against the Majesty of that Emperor, that hath ever nourished thee in the bond of tender compassion and love, and hath raised thee to great Dignities, far unfit for such a Devil incarnate: And from whom may justly procéed the sentence of condemnation, both on thee and me, if he should but understand thy lascivious and wicked practises. Thou (I say) Devil, and worse than Devil) thou that shouldest be unto me instruction, and also a guide to my life and conversation, in this thou goest about my utter ruine and destruction, by thy evil conditions, even be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond that good expectation which the Emperor trusteth to be in thee; O never grant (O ye Gods) that the blood of <hi>France,</hi> from whence I am descended, nor the Emperor my loving Lord, should be so dishonoured either by me in my body, or through my privity in any other manner: O false accursed man, behold whereunto thou wouldest deliver me: First, unto the utter ruine and spoil of mine honor: next, shut up my body in unremoveable shame for ever, amongst men; and lastly bring my soul into the Jaws of Death and the Devil. Let fall, I say, all these thy vile and devil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ish provocations to lust, and leave for ever hereafter to solicite me, or any other vertuous creature on this manner, which if thou fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther prosecute unto me, then canst thou look for nothing but a shameful downfal, and a most damnable death. Therefore with this answer depart, and see that ye attempt me no more.</p>
               <p>Tis angry farewel of the worthy Empress, stung the Priest at the very heart, but at that time durst make no further reply unto the fair Lady concerning love, but as a man all composed of rage and great fury, he then departed, discontent at this his most unfortunate and unhappy chance. At the last, when he could no longer hold he excused himself unto the Lady, craving pardon for these his bold, sawcy and rash follies committed, but yet could find no remedy to restore his honor. Thus being sore troubled in mind divers and sundry ways, he resolved what to do upon revenge against this innocent, which he accordingly effected by Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son against the Lady. And seeing the Emperor knew nothing in this matter from the Empress <hi>Bellysant,</hi> how the Arch-Priest would have inticed her to dishonor, and would have drawn
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:150341:9"/> her to disloyalty to the Emperor, but he could not, therefore he began to accuse her unto the Emperor for divers crimes, as here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after more at large followeth to be spoken in this next ensuing Chapter.</p>

               <head>CHAP. III. How the Arch-Priest having received this repulse at the hands of Bellysant, to save his own honour, practised Treason against the innocent Lady.</head>
               <p>THe Arch-Priest having now begun to set abroach his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vilish practises, began to bethink him how he might effect what he had determined, and also preserve the reputation of his former Honours which the Emperor had bestowed upon him: whereupon at last he resolved, that he would cunningly under the cloak of dissimulation bear fair weather towards the Emperor, as also séemed to shew how great care he had of his preservation and to make known his Loyalty and watchful care that he ever had towards the welfare of his Estate &amp; Person. So it befel, that on a day when he espyed a fit opportunity, and taking the Emperor all alone, he began to break with him on this manner, as followeth:</p>
               <p>Right High and Mighty Emperor, and my very good Lord and Master, I cannot chuse but recount and highly esteem of the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny and innumerable favours, and great kindness which I have always received from your Mighty Highness: wherefore as duty doth always bind me, I am ever most watchful over the passages of your estate, in which I now stand by you appointed; But especially in that you have made me sole Commander in your House, and therein trusted me above all other: therefore it is my duty, to bewray unto you all those carriages that any way concern your High and Migty Person: wherefore I beseech your Highness to give ear to that which I shall now disclose un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:150341:10"/> you, for I had rather suffer all the torments of death, than for to hide any thing from you: and the rather, for that it nearly touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth your person, profit, and honor. O Emperor, thus it is, <hi>Belly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant</hi> your Wife, and Sister to the King of <hi>France,</hi> she whom you have advanced to this state and dignity, faileth in the Duty and loyalty which she oweth unto her dread Lord: for she wandreth in her love, giveth it unto another, which is proper only to your self. To name the person unto your Majesty I will not, for you know I am a sacred Priest, and may not séek the blood of any man: but yet know for certain, that by the way of confession I came unto the light thereof, whereof I neither ought nor will bewray the name of him that thus usurps your Bed: but let it suffice, there is not a more unclean and lacivious woman liveth in your Court or Kingdom, whereby your life is in danger, your honour defamed, and my duty towards you approved by what I have told you. My advice therefore is, to be wary of your person, and correct this her folly, but yet mildly and wisely, always with the preserva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of your Honor. For will it not be a great shame among the Princes of the Earth, that you, having taken a Wife, Sister to a great King one who for her beauty is incomparable, her noble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and Wisdom not to be outshined by any earthly Lad<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>, and she to prove a Whore? and what worse is, one who daily desireth your death, which grieves my heart to think upon.</p>
               <p>The Emperor having heard this long Accusation, little mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trusted the treachery of this Arch-Priest, but gave credit to all his fair, but false words: and therewithal became extream pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive and sad: that his trust in her beautious Love, had been thus deceived. At last, having many days in many places uttered forth many discontented gestures, words, and sighs, and many grievous acclamations, even in the Emperial Palace, he gave rest a while unto his discontented Passions: but wakened Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge to wait upon fitter opportunity. And upon a day enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing into the Chamber of his fair Lady <hi>Bellysant,</hi> without speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any Word to her at all, in most fierce, rude, and unman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly order, took his Lady by the head, and pulling her by the hair, he dragged her about the Chamber, throwing her on the ground in such a horrid manner, that the blood besmeared all her face in
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:150341:10"/> most inhumane sort. The Lady receiving from her Lord such unlookt for welcom, cried out in lamentable manner, and as well as she was able began to say: Alas (my dear Lord) what mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth you to this unwelcome out-rage? I call all the Gods to witness, I never did any thing in my life, either against your ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour or life, or ever prostituted my body to any Strangers love. The Emperour not being thus satisfied, replyed, saying: Thou Whore, I am too well informed of thy proceedings, and cursed be the day and hour that ever I saw thy deceiveable Face, and therewithal, without all pitty dashed her head against the ground leaving her speechless, insomuch that all the Damosels, her atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dants, thought she had been quite bereft of life. Vpon this, there arose up in the Court a most pitiful out-cry, which the Counsel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lors and other Attendants in the Court hearing, ran speedily to the Chamber, whereas they found this Lady in a Trance; at which disaster all amazed, some ran to take up the dead body of the Empress, others took upon them to speak unto the Emperor, thinking thereby to stay the fury of this undeserved rage, whose Words unto him were as followeth.</p>
               <p>Alas (dread Soveraign) what may be the cause of this your sudden passion in delivering unto danger of death, this so modest, chaste and noble a Lady: A Lady so beloved of all degrees, and in whom was never seen the least spark of dishonour, neither to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards you nor any within this Empire: wherefore our request unto you is, that you would moderate your wrong conceived an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger against this harmless Lady. The Emperor nothing for all this relenting, answered, Speak no more, for I know, I see, I hear, how cunningly she hath deluded me: therefore move me no further, for I am fully purposed to deliver her over to death, and be or they who shall hereunto gain-say, I shall make him parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker (in death) with this wicked and disloyal Strumpet.</p>
               <p>These words were no sooner uttered, but up arose a Worthy, Wise, and couragious bold Baron, and spake unto the Emperor after this manner: Right worthy Sir, I could wish you to be well advised before you proceed further against this Lady, who is your espoused wife, sister to a great King, namely <hi>Pepin,</hi> King of <hi>France,</hi> who when he shall hear of this wrong done to her, will out of a
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:150341:11"/> couragious heart and a Brotherly affection, muster up all his men of War, and suddenly surprize our Towns, Houses, Wives, and Children, forgetting Mercy, and onely pursuing revenge upon us, for these Merciless and cruel Deeds unto his Sister. Again, consiver on the other side, that the Lady is great with Child, therefore it is dangerous so rudely to smite and wound her on this manner, wherein you have proceeded against her. The worthy Baron having thus ended his advice, the Lady suddenly fell upon her knees before the Emperor, and in tears very submissively and lamentably, thus she spake:</p>
               <p>Alas (my Lord) take pitty on an innocent Lady, for I am so free from any evil-act, as I never so much as thought any evil a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst your person, or dignity: at least my Lord, if your compas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion be quite distinct from pittying me, yet pitty the fruit of my body, for I am great with child by you, of which the Gods grant me a joyful delivery. If nothing can appease your anger towards me, then let my body be imprisoned in some strong Tower, till the time of my delivery, and then do with my body what pleaseth you, so the fruit of my body may be kept safe. In this dolorous passion she proceeded so far, that what with her sighs and tears following one the other, it would have grieved the sto<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>iest heart that ever rested in the bosom of the vilest Tyrant that ever reigned.</p>
               <p>All this nothing moved the hard-hearted Emperor, who was so wholly bewitched with the false and traiterous accusation of the Arch-Priest, that all lenity set apart, he burst-out in this manner: Thou false Strumpet, the Child thou goest withal is to me no joy, but rather great dishonour, for thy behaviour and thy disloyalty hath made such a seperation between us, that noting thy dissolate life, thou hast made another partner in my love: The Courtiers perceiving nothing could mitigate the rage of the Emperor, by a common consent removed her out of his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence into another Chamber, shewing unto her all the favour they could both in action and gesture, although her fair face was sore deformed and besmeared with blood. Having thus conveyed her away, the Ladies that were Attendants, fetched water to wash her face, and did all they could, to revive her ever-dying Spirits.
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:150341:11"/> Being thus in another chamber, in comes <hi>Blandiman</hi> her Squire, who beholding her in this disfigured manner, for very pitty the water trickled down his cheeks, &amp; at the last he began his speech in this manner.</p>
               <p>Ah Madam, I plainly see that you are trayterously handled, and wish that the Gods would throw down their malignant cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses upon that person that hath thus purchased your extream mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>series; But gentle Lady, take comfort unto you, and trust me, if you will be ruled by me, I will conduct you back again into <hi>France</hi> toward your Brother King <hi>Pepin,</hi> who gave me and my service unto you, to attend you in all these misfortunes, all which I will to the utmost of my power undertake. Swéet Lady, follow my counsel and free your self out of danger, for be you assured, that if here you stay, the Emperor will prosecute revenge upon you, and in the end bring you unto a shameful death.</p>
               <p>Vnto this the sorrowful Lady made this reply; Ah <hi>Blandiman,</hi> I know thy faithful service towards me, but yet, if I should fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low thy advice, &amp; steal out of this Country secretly, it would argue me guilty of all that infamy the Emperor throweth upon me, and thereby yeild me guilty of the deed: Believe me Servant, I had rather dye all the deaths the world can lay upon me, rather than to bear the blame of that wherein I am innocent.</p>
               <p>By this time the Emperors Choller was somewhat pacified, by means of his Lords and Barons that attended, insomuch that he caused <hi>Bellysant</hi> to be quickly brought before him. When she was come, his heart trembled and fretted, for very anger, that he durst not put her to death, fearing the puissance and might of her Brother King <hi>Pepin,</hi> and therefore brast out into these speeches: Thou false and accursed Woman, by whom mine Honour is brought in question: I take the Gods to witness, were it not for thy Brothers sake, the valiant <hi>Pepin</hi> King of <hi>France,</hi> I would make thee fry in the fire, as an example to all fair Ladies: but for his sake I spare thy life, stand forth and hear thy judgement, I banish thee out of my Country and Empire, expresly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding, that without any delay, to morrow thou depart out of this City, and if thou shalt ever be seen here any more, I assure thee thou shalt suffer death in all extremity: Also, I
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:150341:12"/> straightly commanded that none of my Country dare be once <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>o hardy, as to give aid, or accompany you, save onely your servant <hi>Blandiman,</hi> whom you brought with you out of <hi>France.</hi> Go, get thee presently out of my sight, for thou shalt never more sleep in my bosome. The Emperor having pronounced sentence against her, the Empress <hi>Bellysant,</hi> accompanied with her servant <hi>Blan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diman,</hi> speedily hasted to horse. Being thus mounted, and then passing through this fair City towards one of the gates thereof, there met her people in great multitudes, of all degrees, much lamenting the loss of so fair a Lady, and so lovely an Empress. When she came to the utmost part, even ready to go out of the gates of the City, there was heard such a lamentable howling of mournful voices, that the like was never heard in the City of <hi>Constantinople.</hi> When she was out of the walls of the City, and but newly entred into the wide Fields, she began to fall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a womanly fit of bitter wéeping, to see how shamefully and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honourably she was handled, causeless. Again, to think upon her birth, and the imperial dignity from whence she was fallen, as also to account the misfortune wherein she was like to finish the rest of her days, it drave her at last from tears, to utter her griefs in these words: Alas, in what unhappy hour was I born, to fall from so high estate, to so low an object of poverty as I am now in: Woe is me, the unhappiest among women: now are all my joys turned topsy turvy, my laughter is turned into Weeping, my songs converted into fighs: instead of cloath of Gold, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with I was wont to be cloathed, now I am glad of all manner of mean attire: my precious stones of inestimable value, are all taken from me, and Pearls of Tears stand over all my garments. O you fields and woods, to you I make my moan, for other company I have none, consider my exile, and help to bewail my misfortune: O would the Gods had pittied my distress, and made me the poorest among Creatures, then had not Fortune given me so foul a fall, at least my poor estate would never have grived me. Wherefore doth the beauteous Sun send forth his beams upon a wretch so miserable? Why doth the earth bear such a Creature, that is all composed of cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities: It is not possible for my Tongue to tell out my hearts
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:150341:12"/> sorrow. O wretched man (whatsoever thou art) that by thy wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed treason hath brought me to this downfall, I may well curse thee with bitterness of heart, for by thee onely am I made thus unfortunate. Ah, my Brother, what shouldest thou do with such a woful Weight to thy Sister? It had been better I had never been born, than that I should prove such a stain to thy Kingly house. As she was thus complaining to her secret heart, the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish thereof struck her into a swound, as she sat on horse-back, and was ready at that instant to have fallen off her horse, ere her servant could alight and recover her, but he used all the speediest means for her recovery, at last she coming unto her self again, he said unto her: Alas Madam, be not so discomforted, neither let despair so far seize upon you, but trust ye that the Gods will keep and defend you, for they are ready to aid and asist the innocent. Having thus spoken, he suddainly spied a fountain, towards the which he and his Lady took their way, and being come near there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto, he set her down thereby, to ease and refresh her long over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

               <p>THe Arch-Priest having now wrought the banishment of fair <hi>Bellysant,</hi> thought with himself now he should surely accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plish his desire: wherefore in all haste he changed his White Rochet into a Coat of Steel, and begirt unto his side a Sword, and being thus accoutred, he suddenly was mounted upon a Milk-White Steed, the fairest that could be had in all <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantinople.</hi> Being thus mounted, he made after with all ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedition, inquiring of all he met, which way the Lady <hi>Bellysant</hi>
                  <pb n="16" facs="tcp:150341:13"/> was taken, who gladly told him which way she lately passed. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter some few hours Riding, at last he came to a great spaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Forrest, and very long, taking the direct way towards the Lady: It chanced that as he was riding forward, casting his eye aside, he presently espied the Lady with her Servant <hi>Blandiman,</hi> sitting by a Fountain, but suddenly withdrew himself, and coming nearer, found the Lady sitting by the same, full of heaviness, la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menting her miserable fortunes, and by her sat her trusty Servant comforting her.</p>
               <p>This false Priest, from forth his Beaver, well perceived it to be the Lady, but by reason of his disguise, she could not imagine him to be the Arch-Priest, her Enemy: but coming nearer her, she soon discryed him, and being struck with a sudden fear, spake thus to her Servant: Alas (quoth she) I well perceive this to be the false Arch-Priest, that thus cometh towards us, of whom I am exceeding fearful, lest he be come to do me further villany. Lady (quoth <hi>B<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

By this time that they had ended their speech each to other, the Arch-Priest was ready to a light from his Horse, to salute the Lady in all courteous behaviour: and after he had made himself known unto her, he began to say unto her after this manner:</p>
               <p>Right dear Lady, and our late honored Empress, sithy thy case is so pitiful, as to suffer banishment by Sentence given against thee by the Emperor, so it is, that if thou wilt give me enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment in thy Love, accept me into thy favour, and to grant what I have long sought at thy hands, I will bring it to pass that the Emperor shall again recal thy banishment, and make thy greatness of State, shine more bright then ever before: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore advise you well, for I protest what I offer to you, is only ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to your good and advancement. Ha (quoth the Lady) thou disloyal and traiterous adversary, I have no great cause to bestow love, where my life hath been put in jeoparday. It is onely thou that hast wrought my overthrow, &amp; thou it is, that makest me to spend the remnant of my days in more misery then ever Lady is able to indure. Lady (quoth he) utter not forth such curses against
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:150341:13"/> me, for I am come to you, not to vex or trouble you, but to heap upon you more joys than ever you as yet; in all your life enjoyed; and in speaking these words he bended his body to the Lady, think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to have kissed her; but <hi>Blandiman</hi> perceiving his intent, sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly started between them, and gave the Arch-Priest so mighty a stroak that he felled him to the earth, and with the violence of the blow, brake out one of his teeth. The Arch-Priest had no sooner recovered himself from the ground, but suddenly betook him to his sword, which <hi>Blandiman</hi> perceiving, betook him to a Glave which he had about him, whereupon grew a sore and dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous fight between them.</p>
               <p>This incounter lasted so long that they were both wounded, but still they continued fighting, till at last it chanced, a Merchant came by that way, who perceiving a far off their fierce encounter, cryed out with a loud voice, in this manner: Lords, Lords, quoth he, leave off, and shew the cause of this your variance, and I shall do my best to end this controversie. Sir, (quoth <hi>Blandiman</hi>) let us first try our right by our weapons, and afterwards we will be ruled by words. But the poor Lady could no longer bear silence, but began to tell the Merchant as followeth. Alas (quoth she) as you ever pittyed woman, pitty my case, for this man, whom here you see armed, is the false and traiterous Arch-Priest, that hath followed me to rob me of mine Honour, and force me to his wicked and unsatiate Lust: Also, this is he that hath made a sepe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration between me and the Emperor my Lord and Husband. The Merchant hearing her lamentable tale, pittyed her misery, and began thus unto the Arch-Priest; Sir Priest, leave off your enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize, and dare not so much as to touch this innocent Lady, for if the Emperor did but understand this villany, he would soon end thy life in infamy, as thou well deservest. As soon as the Arch-Priest had heard his speech he forsook his combate, and fled as fast as he could through the wood, for fear of being further known, being prevented of his purpose toward the Lady: though he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veied his body out of sight, yet his villanies were afterwards dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>closed. After his departure the Lady was forced to stay still in the wood all sorrowful, with her wounded servant. The Merchant staid with them some little time, bewailing the hard hap of the
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:150341:14"/> Lady; yet comforted her, saying: Alas Lady! I see that this Arch-Priest hath falsely betrayed you, and brought you in hatred with the Emperor, but I will promise you, that if I live I will bewray all these Treacheries to the Emperor, and bring the Traitor to a shameful death, and so taking leave, I commend you to the Gods, wishing that in these extremities <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

In this extasie, leave we her, and now pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed to the other Child, which she left under the Tree.</p>

The King perceiving it to be <hi>Blandiman,</hi> asked what good news from <hi>Constantinople,</hi> and above the rest, how doth our Sister <hi>Bellysant? Blandiman</hi> answered: Most gracious Soveraign, I bring you but little tydings, yet those I bring are bitter and sharp: For (amongst the rest) I must tell you strange news of our loving Sister, and how she fares: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore so it is, That by force of Treason, and false suggestion of the cursed Arch-Priest of <hi>Constantinople,</hi> your Sister is banished out of the Emperors Court, and Dominions, and but for the great mercy of the Lords of the Emperors Court, and others, she had been publiquely put to death, and burnt to ashes, in the sight of all the people.</p>
               <p>King <hi>Pepin</hi> having heard the lamentable relation of <hi>Blandimans</hi> report, being exceeding outragious and fierce in anger (and yet sorrowful withal) brake out in speech most bitterly against her, on this manner: Now by the Gods, quoth he, I hold the Emperor no upright Iudge, in that he spared the life of my Sister: for I swear, that if I had her here now in my possession, I would not rest, till by death I had made her an example to all false Ladies, while the world endureth: and therewithal commanded all his train of Lords, and others, to stay their journey of going forward, and make their return back again to <hi>Paris,</hi> for the grievous offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of my Sister, here stays my journey, and so be departed, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out further asking any more questions, but turning his horses head, sorrow overcame his courage, and at last made him break forth into these words: Ha (quoth he) how many men are deceived in Women? Now am I utterly prevented of all my
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:150341:16"/> purposes, for my only hope rested in the modesty of my Sister <hi>Bellysant,</hi> yea and in her stood all my joys and pleasure. Again, to have had the Emperor <hi>Alexander</hi> still my Brother, and fast friend at all assaies, and in all my necessities, was my only hope, and joy of heart, and now behold by her I am disappointed, defamed, and shut out into eternal dishonour. And so in that distrust and melancholy, King <hi>Pepin</hi> returned again towards <hi>O leance.</hi> When <hi>Blandiman</hi> perceived the courage of the King to be thus daunted, he durst relate no further news of the Lady <hi>Bellysant,</hi> but leaving the King took his way towards the Trée, where he lately left her in great pain of Child-birth: being come thither, he sought her every where, but could hear no tydings of her: wherefore being sorrowful, he knew not what way to take.</p>
               <p>Being in this extasie, at last he tyed up his horse to a thorn-trée, and began again to make a narrower search than before; wherein he was so vigilant, that anon he espyed her, finding her flat upon the earth, in a manner spéechless, for very grief of heart that she had lost her Child, which the Bear had violently bore away from her. <hi>Blandiman</hi> being glad, that now at last he had found her, kindly embraced her, and taking her up in his arms from the cold earth, set her upon her feet, and began thus unto her: Alas, (dear Lady and Mistress) how happened you to stray thus far from the place I left you in?</p>
               <p>The Lady looking upon him with a ghastly countenance, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed thus: Ah <hi>Blandiman!</hi> my dolors and distresses daily increase upon me. For thou wert no sooner departed, to get me the help of some woman-kind, but I being delivered of two Babes, a Ravenous Bear from the Forrest assailed me, and bare away one of them. I, although weak, making what poor shift I was able, followed that ravenous Beast, thinking by strong hand to have recovered again my loss, but all in vain, I could not overtake the Bear, nor wanting my strength, recover back again to the Trée, where I left my other Infant. Lady (quoth he) the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Infant? why I my self but lately came from the Trée, and I am well assured that there lay no Infant there, nor near thereabout. How (quoth the Lady) no Child under the Tree? With these words she was so inwardly wounded, that she fell down in
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:150341:16"/> a swound, which <hi>Blandiman</hi> espying, saved her (in what he could) and fell into brinish tears for grief and sorrow, to see his Lady so extreamly plunged, and overwhelmed, and at last led her towards the Tree, where she had left the Child, but when she saw that other Child also gone, think then what dolour of heart the poor Lady endured: in the midst of all which sorrows, she thus be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>speak.</p>
               <p>Alas (quoth she) can there be in the world a more desolate wretch, on every side compassed with grief, yea, and all insup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portable sorrows? but alas Emperor, thou art the cause, and hast been the only means even to deliver me even to death, and that wrongfully without cause on my part, and only by deceiveable counsel hast thou bereft me of thy company; But here I call all the Gods to witness that I was never faulty to thee in my body, nor disobedient unto thee in any point: wherefore once again I am forced to cry out for vengeance upon the offenders head: whosoever. First, for my disgrace; next, for my banishment, and now lastly for the loss of my two Babes, issued from the blood Royal of the Emperor of <hi>Constantinople.</hi> But seeing all these miseries have even tyred themselves upon my very heart, Come death, and finish what sorrows do but prolong. All this while <hi>Blandim<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

But his brows were bent and full of anger against you; wherefore Lady, my counsel is, that you make not towards him, for by that countenance I well perceive you shall have but slender welcome. For upon further questions demanded, and answered, so soon as he heard me tell
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:150341:17"/> that the Emperor had exiled you, he lightly gave credit that yours was the fault, and therefore he lays all the blame on you. O! (quoth the Lady) now what I most feared is come to pass, and I well perceive that I am beset with adversaries on every side: Well, be it as it may be, the Emperor hath exiled me without cause, what then shall I do? I will never return again to <hi>Paris,</hi> but take my way into some remote Land, where my body with my faults shall be smothered: For my Brothers anger is grown so great, that he could willingly deliver me over to death; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is better to flye and to save my life, then fall into the fury of so angry a Brother. This doleful speech she delivered in tears, which <hi>Blandiman</hi> perceiving, said unto her: Lady leave off your tears, for be assured of my faithful service, and here I offer my self, life, and all to be at your service; go whither you please. Why then (quoth the Lady) since thou art so resolute, let us resolve upon some strange adventure, and therewithal passed forth to expose themselves to future dangers; where now we shall be forced to leave them with sorrowful hearts, and return again to speak something of the Bear, that carried away one of the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren.</p>

The Fair or Mart-day being come, the Emperor gave the charge thereof unto this Arch-Priest, who accordingly provided himself, and to the same purpose armed 200 men to guard his own person: being thus accompained, he took his wa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

Now mark what followed: This Merchant among the rest, was richly furnished with all rich and costly wares as Cloath of Gold, Silver Silk, &amp;c. where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by he received great wealth, and took more money than any five Merchants beside. The Fair being ended the Arch-Priest sent forth his officers, to demand and receive his accustomed duties due upon the sale of those Merchandizes. The officers came unto this Merchant, and said, Sir, you must pay ten pence on every pound that you have taken, for so it is ordained by the great offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer to whom it doth belong.</p>

The Arch-Priest glad of this oportunity, would suddenly have put him to death, but the Merchant appealed to Iustice, to have his cause tryed by the Law.

Say on, said the Emperor: Mighty Emperor and my Lords all, I would advise you to make fast the Gates round about this your Palace, that none depart from this place. The Emperor did as he requestev: then said the Merchant with a loud voice, Lords, Barons, and Knights, all you that love the honor of the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror, and the Triumphant Reign of his person, attend my words: For the time is come that the Treason of the cursed Arch-Priest will now be revealed and come to light. Then thus great Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror, this is that cursed man whom you have ever nourished, and brought to great honor, who hath deceived your trust; for he it is that hath wrought all the discord, betwixt you and your vertu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Lady, whom you have banished both from your Bed, Court, and Country, and by whom you have received more dishonor than ever he reaped honor from you: For it had béen his part most of any to have nourished and advanced your Renown, and to have preserved your honor, but contrarily he hath made my Dread Lord infamous by these his wicked projects, &amp; brought upon you great scandal among all Nations: for he secretly and onder-hand made love to your Empress, but she denyed him: the which he perceiving, that there was no likelihood to accomplish his desire, it drove him into a thousand fears, lest this his disloyal act should come to light: and therefore devised to falsifie unto your ears, her faithful love unto your Bed. Of all which his false accusati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, I say here before you, and all your Lords and Barons, that he lyeth like a Traitor, &amp; for the more approbation of what I have uttered, I will here unfold the truth of what these eyes of mine were witnesses.</p>
               <pb n="30" facs="tcp:150341:20"/>
               <p>It so happened on a day (after the banishment of the Empress <hi>Bellysant</hi>) as I was riding about my affairs, I chanced to tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel through a wood: at last passing along the way, I found this treacherous Priest transformed out of the habit of his Priesthood, into the shape of a Knight, even armed at all points ready for the combate with the enemy. Drawing nearer and nearer, I might behold him in fight with another man unarmed, which at last I found to be <hi>Blandiman,</hi> Squire to the banished Lady, who con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted her in the time of her exile.</p>
               <p>Ill perceiving they encountred one another so-fiercely, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to call unto them, to give over their direful fight: but they little regarded what I said: I did perceive the Lady piteously weeping, and at last said unto me thus: Gentle Merchant, and kind friend, lend me thy aid against this treacherous Arch-Priest, that seeketh by force to rob me of mine honour. This is he, and onely he, by whom I am banished from my Emperors Bed and Country. With that I put spurs to m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

Noble Emperor it had been my part to have revealed this long before, but I durst not open my Mouth unto you, for fear his greatness would have out-swa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ed my truth, and so have brought my self unto an untimely death.</p>
               <p>The Emperor having heard this tale, sighed, and at last fell into tears: in which tears he turned him unto the Arch-Priest, relating his disloyalty in this manner: Ah thou false servant (quoth he) have I ever studied to do thee honor, and exalt thée to high dignities, and hast thou quitted all my love and trust with disloy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alty and treasons? Well, I have seen now what I ever mistrust<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, thou hast made me of all men most unhappy. But it is not so much thy fault as my own, thy treason hath bewitched me: In an evil hour I gave credit to thy false speaking tongue, and thereby deserve to carry the brand of my own folly.</p>
               <p>The Arch-Priest hearing the Emperor thus distempered, began to intreat his Highness not to be so impatient, neither to give credit to this slanderous tale that the Merchant had commenced against him: for (quoth he) he be lyeth me, and I am no way guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:150341:20"/> of that wherewith he accuseth me: thou lyest falsly (quoth the Merchant) thou canst not excuse thy self in what I have charged thee withal, and if thou stand still in the denyal, I challenge thee by the single Combate, to maintain the truth, and try my Ouar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel: and hereupon, I throw down my gage, and withal tender my body thereunto, for to make good what I have here spoken: and more than that, ere night shut in, I will deliver thy body to death, or yeild my self vanquished.</p>
               <p>The Emperor seeing the Merchant so resolute, and to stand to the tryal of the combate, he said: Arch-Priest, it is time that either thou quit thy self by answering this challenge, or to yeild thy self guilty of what hath been laid to thy charge. The Arch-Priest re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied on this manner: Mighty Emperor, I must let you under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand, that to answer the Merchants challenge, or take up Arms, is contrary to my place and calling, for I am a sacred Prelate of the Church, and therefore I may refuse to fight. Nay (quoth the Emperor) in this case no excuse is to be admitted, but you must ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther fight, or yeild your self a Traitor to our Crown and dignity. At these words the Arch-Priest was somewhat troubled in mind, yet at last he was fain to accept the Combate, because the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror charged him so deeply: and besides, he could have no excuse ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted. So the Emperor commanded them both to safe keeping, till such time he had sent Letters to King <hi>Pepin</hi> of <hi>France:</hi> but in conclusion the Traitor had his desart, as hereafter followeth.</p>

The Emperor hearing of his coming, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded all the Bells to be rung, and made triumphe to welcome him, for all were filled with joy at his approach. The Emperor mounted on horse-back, richly accompanied, marched out of the City to meet his Brother King. At last they met, but the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror overcome with sorrow and tears at the remembrance of <hi>Bellysant,</hi> could not utter a Word. On the other side, <hi>Pepin</hi> being fiercely angred at what happened to his Sister, gave no respect unto the Emperors tears, but proudly began to gird him on this manner; Emperor (quoth he) leave off these your lamentations, and shake off these weeds of sorrow that you seem to wear for my Sister <hi>Bellysant;</hi> for he that hath a harlot unto his wife, I account him mad to grieve at her misbehaviour, and since my Sister hath proved such a one, let her go and take care for her self, she is not worthy of so much as one tear from such an eye of Majesty.</p>
               <p>Nay, nay, said the Emperor, speak not you so evilly against your Sister, for I am now fully perswaded, that she is composed of all vertue and true honesty, and that against all equity, I have ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished her out of my Country.

                  </gap>, you would with such rigor proceed against an innocent Lady, and so suddenly (like a common Harlot) throw her out into banish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, shame, and dishonour, being of the Blood Royal of <hi>France.</hi> The Emperor hearing the King to be so bitter against him, he was very sorrowful, and said unto him in this manner; Alas, my Lord, do not thus follow me with wrath and anger, but rather turn your tongue upon some milder saying, for to that intent have I sent for you, that your own eyes may be a witness of the truth. 'Tis true (quoth King <hi>Pepin</hi>) but it is all too late what now you say, for you have delivered over my Sister into the worlds infamy, and that more is, even to banishment; and (for ought I know) to death it self, for I know not whether ever I shall behold her face again, or not: Fie, fie, that you being so great a Person, should be so af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectionately born away, to give such sudden judgement against an
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:150341:22"/> Innocent; I do confess, one may commit a foul and dishonorable act, but Repentance is able to make amends, and not so suddenly to overthrow their Dignity and Renown: For that once lost, whether it be right or wrong, it is never again possible to be reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered. Again, how little have you esteemed of the honour of my Kingly office, judge you, when first without deliberation, and next without any knowledge given me, you have proceeded so against my Sister? I make it plain against you, that envy towards her and me, was the only cause of these false &amp; unjust wrongs done against us. Whilst these words passed betwixt them, they were now entred <hi>Constantinople,</hi> where with great joy and gladness they were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived of the Inhabitants. The Emperor would have had King <hi>Pepin</hi> to have lodged with him in his Palace, but the King denyed, and caused his Train to lodge within the City, and he himself also. Then the Emperor caused many gifts and presents to be offered him, but he disdainfully rejected them: for King <hi>Pepin</hi> thought of nothing but the dishonour done unto his Sister, and that the rather, for the whole City accounted her the fairest, the most vertuous, and the chastest Lady in all the world; and that by injustice and treason she was banished.</p>

Then they began to set forward to another course, charging each other with their swords, in such violent manner, that with their fury they redounded from their Armor to the ground cutting off whole quarters of their Corslets, and left them as a prey for those that attended the fight.</p>
               <p>The Arch-Priest séeing himself so stifly matched, gave over the fight till towards the evening (for such was the custom of the Country, that in any challenged Combate either party might refuse to follow the fight so eagerly, but that they might have a breathing time, so the Combate were yielded vanquished before Sun-set, or else abide the sentence of death) thinking thereby to weary out the Merchant. Which the Merchant being privy unto, so behaved himself, that he prepared to receive the Arch-Priest couragiously when he encountred him; insomuch that when they come together to make tryal of their valor, and to get conquest,
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:150341:23"/> the one over the other, the Merchant so redoubled his stroaks, that at last he smote off one of his ears, and his steel Habergion, and with the violence of the same blow, the Merchants sword fell from his hand. The Arch-Priest perceiving his enemy unarmed, he put spurs to his horse, and charged him with such violence, that he ran against the Merchants horse and thrust out one of his eyes: the horse feeling himself hurt, ran up and down as mad, leaping and curvetting so furiously that he unhorsed his rider, and so hard was the fortune of the Merchant, that in his fall, his foot hung fast in the stirrop, whereby he was brought into great danger, the horse hurrying him along the field, that all were very sorrowful to behold this lamentable spectacle, and with the amazement thereof grew desperate in their hopes; King <hi>Pepin</hi> also was sore discou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged at this disasterous chance, that the tears did even trickle down his cheeks, and in a silent speech to himself, thus he spake. Alas Merchant, I now well perceive thy days are at an end, and that the trust I reposed in thee is utterly frustrate: for by thy fall I see my Sisters chastity to be weak; and the rather, for that the Gods hath suffered thée to fall so unluckily this day; so that I must needs confess that the Emperor hath done well in expulsing her his Kingdom: Oh, that her day of birth, had proved her day of bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial, it had been happy for her, but thrice happier to me, for only by her is the blood Royal of <hi>France</hi> brought into great infamy: and were it so, I had her at my dispose, I would be the first man should see execution done upon her, even to death.</p>
               <p>Now, that which was so miraculous, was, all this time that the Merchant was dragged up and down the field, the Arch-Priest could not inforce his Horse to come up unto the Merchant; but fled out too and fro, whereby he could not make a prey upon the Merchant, as he thought to have done. But see, at the last the Merchants Horse, that had thus drawn him up and down the field, foundred and fell down, which gave great advantage to the Merchant, who with that fall got his Leg from forth the stirrop, and at last got up on his feet, like a valiant and hardy Champion. The Arch-Priest perceiving the Merchant had recovered his legs, came running with strong violence upon him, and thereby lent him five or six sore blows upon his head and shoulders, that the
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:150341:24"/> poor Merchant was even a stonied. At last, he was forced to give back to recover breath, and in a very little space, finding himself somewhat relieved, he subtilly and fiercely gave a fresh assault upon the Arch-Priest, against whom he struck with such violence, that the sword fell out of his hand, but he had first so wounded the Arch-Priest, that the blood ran quite through his armor upon the earth. This so vexed the Arch-Priest, that he grew mad with rage, and turned his horse upon the Merchant, minding to have over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>run him with his horse. But the Merchant perceiving his drift, prepared to receive him, and therewithal drew a long knife, and panched it into the belly of the horse, so that the horse being thus wounded, began to fling and leap, insomuch as the Arch-Priest was in danger to be unhorst, and doing what he could to save him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, he lost his Shield. The Merchant espyed him thus unarmed, ran hastily and caught up the Shield, and threw it away, so that he could no more recover it: that done, he made again towards his horse, and smote him into the belly with his sword, so that by this time, both the horse and his rider came tumbling down upon the ground.</p>
               <p>The Arch-Priest being thus unhorst, was very nimble to reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver himself, but yet the Merchant watching all opportunity, lent him such a blow, that as he began to rise, he laid him flat again upon the ground, and then leaped upon him, pulled off his helmet, thinking to have smitten off his head, when the Arch-Priest saw himself thus vanquished, he was exceeding wroth, but seeing little availed, he said thus unto the Merchant: Alas, my Friend, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>séech thee take mercy upon me, and while I am yet living, give me some time to confess my self, that I may free my soul of dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, for to thee I yield my self as vanquished. The Merchant hearing him say so, was very courteous, and granted him his desire. The Priest had no sooner gotten on his feet, but he forsook his confession, and suddenly got the Merchant in his arms and threw him on the ground, and leapt upon him in most sudden out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage, saying thus to the Merchant, I have thée now at advantage, and from my hands thou shalt not escape with life, if what I shall command thee thou do not effect. Ha! replyed the Merchant, hast thou thus betrayed me. Well, it is so, that now I stand at thy
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:150341:24"/> mercy, &amp; that thou mayst do with me what pleaseth thee: therefore let me know what it is thou commandest, and so thou save my life I shall gladly do it. Then thus; go with me before the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror and King <hi>Pepin,</hi> and there openly in the hearing of all men, testifie that thou falsely hast accused me, and that thereby I may be cleared of those false clamunations which by thy means have been brought upon me: all which if thou effectually accomplish, I swear and promise thee to save thy life, and besides, be a means unto the Emperor and his Brother, to buy thee peace and forgive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of this thy foul fact committed both against me and them also: Nay more, I swear to thee by the Faith of a Gentleman, and by the Order of Priest-hood, to give thee a Néece of mine in marriage, who shall be to thée rich, fair, &amp; of pleasant behaviour: and to conclude, thou shalt say more then any of thy kindred ever told, thou shalt be made more honourable and wealthy: Therefore now advise thy self, whether thou wilt be made happy in an honourable life, or miserable in an untimely death. The Merchant having heard heard the Arch-Priests tale, was upon the suddain excéeding sorrowful, and not without cause, but not knowing on the sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain, what to resolve upon, he at length thus answered: Sir Priest, your Arguments are grounded upon good reasons, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I am ready to accomplish your desires, so that you will be as mindful of your oaths and promises. In me quoth the Arch-priest, there shall appear no fault. Why then (quoth the Merchant) let us set forwards towards the Emperor, and there will I set you frée from all those accusations which heretofore I have exhibited against you. It is well, said the Arch-Priest, wherefore rise up then, and let us go together. The Merchant had no sooner got on his feet, but he began again a fresh to open all the Treason of the Arch-Priest, even to his teeth, and again he took courage, and now would requite him in the same swa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>e he had served him before: and suddenly he clasp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Arch-Priest in his arms, he threw him down, and having him at advantage, he said thus: Arch-Priest; you have taught me to pla<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> my part, and therefore think no more upon confessions, for you shall confess to me or none. The Arch-Priest seeing himself beaten at his own weapons, began again to entreat, but
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:150341:25"/> the Merchant not regarding his words, presently put out his eys, and gave him so many deadly blows, that he made him sure enough for rising to do him any harm. Then the Merchant called y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> Marshals of the Field, and said: Lo here you may see that I have done my best endeavour against the Arch-Priest, and if he be van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quished, say so, for I am sure I have brought him to such a pass, that I may kill him ought-right if I please. Therefore my re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest now unto you is, that you would conduct <hi>Alexander</hi> Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror of <hi>Constantinople,</hi> and King <hi>Pepin</hi> of <hi>France,</hi> hither to this place, accompanied with their worthy Lords and Knights, that they may be ear-witnesses of the confession which the Arch-Priest shall make unto him, and also to hear in what unjust manner he waged this Combat against me.</p>
               <p>The Marshals did according to the request of the Merchant, and then presently came King <hi>Alexander</hi> the Emperor, with King <hi>Pepin,</hi> and all the Nobles, even to the place where the Arch-Priest lay all sorrowful, and fully vanquished. Then the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror demanded of him the truth of the matter, which the Arch-Prest confessed, declaring the whole plot of his villanies, and how by his means the Lady <hi>Bellysant</hi> had been wrongfully banish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. When the standers by heard all the whole matter, a multitude of tears were shed on every side, but especially the Emperor, for his lamentations were so violent, that all that were about him wept with great bitterness and hearty sorrow. Now if the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror were so sorrowful, what may you think of King <hi>Pepin</hi> her Brother. Alas it was not without great cause, when they saw and knew that by too much trust given to a treacherous Priest they had lost the vertuous Lady <hi>Bellysant.</hi> Between these two great Princes there was great joy and great sorrow: Ioy to K. <hi>Pepin,</hi> that his Sister was found innocent and blameless: Sorrow to the Emperor, that he should be the only means (by false suggestions) of his wives banishment.</p>
               <p>At last, lamentations was laid apart: when they had heard all the confessions of the Arch-Priests Treasons; The Emperor con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sulted with his counsel that the Traitor should be put into a Caldron of hot burning oyl, quick, and so finish his miserable days, as he had traiterously sought the life of that innocent La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy:
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:150341:25"/> So the execution was suddenly to be done, and it being done, the assembly of people of all sorts was dismissed.</p>
               <p>Afterwards King <hi>Pepin</hi> withdrew himself towards his lodging, but the Emperor sorrowful for what had happened, came before King <hi>Pepin,</hi> and humbling himself at his feet, began thus to say: Alas dear Brother, I am all sorrowful for this my error, in that I have so rashly committed such a detestable crime against you, my Lady your Sister, and the residue of these great Nobles your at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendants: Let it suffice, that I behold my own folly, what shall I say? I can but crave pardon for my fault, and give my self into your hands, and do to me whatsoever pleaseth you: and for a fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther satisfaction, I render up into your hands my Empire, with all the Regality thereunto appertaining: for I am altogether unworthy to rule an Empire, that am not master of mine own af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections.

                  </gap>ay, for I will no longer be served, but during the rest of my life will become a Servant to thee or any: for no better have I deserved. King <hi>Pepin</hi> perceiving the Emperor so passionate, and so humble minded, kindly took him from the ground, and before all his Lords, freely forgave all trespasses. So that before they parted, there was a general peace concluded on both parties between them, and a most speedy course taken to send abroad into all parts of the world to seek out the distressed Lady <hi>Bellysant.</hi> Thus all things settled in order, King <hi>Pepin</hi> prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to take his leave of the Emperor, and so returned back again into his own Country.</p>

                  </gap>red, by reason that it was one of the goodliest Forrests in the Realm of <hi>France.</hi> Being (as I said) come hither, he caused great Banquets to be made for his welcome home: which was accordingly perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med.</p>
               <p>In the midst of their I castings and Revellings, the Esquire that had the charge of the Orphan <hi>Valentine,</hi> took and presented him before the King, saying unto his Majesty on this manner: Dread Soveraign, Lo, here I present before you the poor Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phan that your Majesty found in the Forrest of <hi>Orleance,</hi> and the same Child which you commanded me to see brought up, not at mine expence, Dread Soveraign, but at your own. My Leige, the reason why I make tender of him unto you at this time, is, because he is growing to mans estate; and so may it please your Majesty, it is time to dispose of him as you please: The King ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving heard the words of the Esquire, called this Orphan (named <hi>Valentine</hi>) unto him, and took him by the hand, and moved divers questions unto him, all which he answered with much modesty, and great wisdom, and being ravished therewith, commanded that all his Cupbord of Plate should be given unto him. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over (said the King) I command that this Orphan <hi>Valentine</hi> be dearly preserved &amp; kept, for that you shall perceive I respect him above common love, I will also, that this Infant shall be nourish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed &amp; kept with my Daughter <hi>Eglantine,</hi> she is both fair, wise, and well endowed with all the richest gifts of Nature.</p>
               <p>The King having given this command, it was accordingly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complished, insomuch that they were both under one government of one and the same Nurse, and had one and the same attendants: yea, every way they joyed one in the company of the other, in such wise, that if the one was but a little absent from the other, there was a kind of lamentation till they came together again: but especially the Kings daughter, who so pondred on the prudent carriages of the Orphan, that she became in love with him, insomuch as his absence brought her into a thousand fears, and
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:150341:26"/> drave her melancholly thoughts into a thousand doubts.</p>
               <p>Now <hi>Valentine</hi> was ever practising himself in seats of Arms, as Horse, Armor, Iusts, and Turnaments, still exposing him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self to all dangers whatsoever. The King wisely beholding the inclination of this youth, allotted unto him what his heart desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, furnished him with Armor, Horse, Lands, Revenues, and made him Lord of rich possessions. Being thus furnished, there arose within the Court many secret mutterings, whereby many fret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted so sore in envy towards him, that they uttered forth many re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proachful words against him, sa ing, that when he was at the best, he was but a found stra<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>, poor, base, without any known Parents or Friends, of no gentle or noble stock and such like: which when <hi>Valentine</hi> heard, he could take no other revenge, but sit him down and weep: whose tears fair <hi>Eglantine</hi> perceiving, would in a ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der woman-like affection accompany him, even pouring forth her tears also for company.</p>
               <p>At length when he saw tears little availed, he began to forsake it, and taking heart, bore himself like a man, amidst the greatest in the Court, carrying himself in such humble and gentle frame, that he gained the love of all sorts, and degrees, as well Nobles, as Inferiours.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Valentine</hi> thus growing up in love of the Court, all this while his Brother <hi>Orson</hi> runs in the Forrest, all rough and covered with hair like a Bear, and leading the life of a Beast, where we leave him for a while, and return unto the affairs of King <hi>Pepin.</hi> It so chanced, that there came unto <hi>Orleance</hi> divers Ambassa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors from the Pope, demanding aid against the <hi>Sarazens,</hi> enemies of the holy faith, who had lately taken the City of <hi>Rome</hi> by vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence: King <hi>Pepin</hi> understanding hereof by divers Letters recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved addressed himself, &amp; his powers to make resistance against this common enemy. And amongst the rest of his worthy followers, he ordained this young <hi>Valentine</hi> a chief commander. Fair <hi>Eg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lantine</hi> hearing that <hi>Valentine</hi> should make one, became wondrous heavy and sorrowful; for that she loved him more than any other Creature, and secretly by stealth sent a Messenger unto him to come and speak with her: and when he came, she sighing, said un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him. Alas <hi>Valentine,</hi> my Love, now I am quite bereft of all
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:150341:27"/> my joy, for I perceive you will betake your self to a dangerous War. Gentle Love, leave me not so desolate, would to the Gods, that I had neither Father nor friend in the world to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradict my will, &amp; then shouldest thou soon perceive how well my affection stands to thy person: for if wishes might avail, I swear (by the Gods) thou art the only man I would joyn my self unto in the bands of marriage, and then shouldest thou be the King of <hi>France,</hi> and I Queen. The young man hearing her idle ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginations, said, Madam, leave these womanish dotages, you know I am no person fitting your estate, I am but a found stray that your father hath caused long time to be nourished for charity sake. I am no way either fitting you, or the meanest Damosel attending your person, make your choice else-where, and joyn Royal blood unto yours, and so with all duty I take my leave, and commend you to the Gods. Having thus ended his speech, away he goes, leaving the poor Lady all heavy, deso<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

               <p>By this time, the King and all his Powers were in a readiness to depart, and taking their way from <hi>Orleance</hi> towards <hi>Rome,</hi> they went through a mighty Forrest, and being entred, the King called his Lords and Barons together, and said thus unto them. My Lords it is not unknown unto you, that in these Woods (as report goeth) there liveth a strange monster, a Wild-man, much feared of Passengers, which spectacle of mans shape, I long to behold, before I venture out any further upon our intended voy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age to <hi>Rome.</hi> The Lords generally consented, and the chase was suddenly appointed. Being entred the Wood, they chased divers sorts of Wild-beasts, and overcame them: but as for <hi>Orson</hi> the Wild-man, none durst adventure the finding forth of him, save onely his Brother <hi>Valentine</hi> (but he knew nothing) &amp; he follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed still the chase, hoping at last both to find and to fight with him also. Every way they begirt the Wood, some one way, some ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: the King himself ventured so far, that he came before a Cave, dark, &amp; obscure, whereas this Wild-man used to hide him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self. <hi>Orson</hi> perceiving the King, rushed out upon him, caught him within his nails (the which were long and crooked) and in rough and ravenous manner, cast him on the ground. The King thus
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:150341:27"/> suddenly surprized by a savage man, never lookt for life, but in a piteous manner cryed out for help, who was seconded by a valiant Knight at Arms, which espying the King to be almost strangled, suddenly drew his sword to have run the Wild-man through. <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son</hi> perceiving the glittering sword, left the King and ran furi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> upon the Knight, took him in his arms, that he overthrew him Horse and all. The Horse sore affrighted, got up again, and in a mad fit ran up and down the Forrest, but as for the Rider (though a Kt. at Arms) <hi>Orson</hi> held him so fast with his twangs and talons, that at last he pulled him in peices. In the mean space the King escaped, and meeting part of his company, related to them the great danger he had escaped, and the fearful death of the Knight. These tydings much amazed the rest of the company: yet being manfully resolved, they joyned themselves together, and marched towards the cave to meet with <hi>Orson,</hi> and either to take him alive, or to put him to death in the Cave. But being come thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, they found the Knight dead &amp; torn in peices, but <hi>Orson</hi> they could not find for the Gods had reserved him to be conquered on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by his Brother <hi>Valentine:</hi>) of whose proceedings you shall hear more hereafter.</p>
               <p>So the King perceiving their labor lost, gave over the chase, and set forward towards <hi>Rome.</hi> After this, the King ranked his forces into battel-ray, and the great Ensign of <hi>France</hi> was given to one called <hi>Myllan Daugler,</hi> a very valiant Prince, and a wise-Leader, so that he and his two Brethren, <hi>Gervays</hi> and <hi>Sampson,</hi> had the whole command of the Forces that then were marching towards <hi>Rome.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>When they were come unto <hi>Rome,</hi> King <hi>Pepin</hi> desired battel, and would fain understand the state that the City now stood in, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the conquest of the <hi>Sarazans,</hi> but it was told him he should not be too inquisitive of those affairs: for the Admiral of the <hi>Sarazens</hi> had surprized the City, and put multitudes to the sword, and had spoiled and defaced all the Churches, and made them Temples fit for their Heathenish Idols; and he constrained the Pope, with his Cardinals, Arch-Bishops, Bishops, Priors, Monks, Friers &amp; all the Ecclestastical persons, for to serve at their Heathenish Altars; and to sacrifice to their Devils, after the custome of the Heathens.</p>

               <p>When King <hi>Pepin</hi> understood hereof he was much inraged, to hear that the Christians were thus captivated by Heathens: Wherefore he addressed himself nearer unto the City, and there having assembled all his forces, he began to draw them into di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers Squadrons, meaning thereby to give them a suddain assault, for his fury was so great against these Heathenish <hi>Sarazens,</hi> that he vowed revenge upon them: but taking better advise, he reser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved himself &amp; his Arm<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

So coming thither, he came before the Admiral, and saluted him after this manner: The Gods preserve the Noble &amp; Puissant King <hi>Pepin,</hi> my Lord and Soveraign: and <hi>M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

When <hi>Valentine</hi> had thus spoken the Admiral rowzed him from his Chair, and with fierce and frow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning brow replied thus unto him: Messenger return, and get thee gone out of my sight, and say thus unto King <hi>Pepin,</hi> will him ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther renounce his faith, and believe on <hi>Mahomet,</hi> or else let him look to receive no other sentence then death, and so destroy him, together with all his Lands and Kingdom. Get thee gone and make here no longer abode, go I say reply not a Word, for my heart is all inraged, that so long I suffer thee.</p>
               <p>Again, I tell thee, that for thy part, thou hast committed a haughty enterprise, thus to enter my Palace, to deliver any such message unto me. Wherefore I assure thee, by the height of my Majesty, If that I did assuredly know that what thou hast done were through pride of heart and ensolency, thereby to make a mock at our Majesty, thou shouldst never return to King <hi>Pepin,</hi> to carry an answer to thy proud Masters Letters. <hi>Valentine</hi> hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring these hot and furious words sounding from the Admiral, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to be afraid: wherefore deliberating with himself what to reply, he mildly said, High and Mighty Emperor, do not ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine that by pride or presumption I am come before you, for when

I perceiving my self in this danger, sought rather to save my life, than to lose both life and honour, and therefore gave it forth throughout the Court, that I would undertake to come to your Court to defie you on King <hi>Pepins</hi> behalf: and therewithal, that I would chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge you to break three Spears with you in single combate, to try your valiancy, and to win unto my self that lost honour that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I told unto you: wherefore my request is, that your Great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness would grant me my request, otherwise I dare never return again, lest the King put me to death. The Admiral hearing this pittiful, yet cunning tale of <hi>Valentine,</hi> said unto him, Son, I do swear by <hi>Mahomet,</hi> thou shalt not be refused, but at this instant I offer thee the Iusts, and to the end, that those French-men that lye in siege before the City may have a sight hereof, and see thy valour, I will ordain the place of Iusting to be without the City. <hi>Valentine</hi> humbly thanked him, and in token of his acceptance and feigned love, he fell down and kissed the feet of the Admiral. <hi>Valent<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

'Tis true (quoth he) and not without cause, for I am much afraid that I shall be slain in these Iusts, wherefore my request is, that I may have a Confessor to give me absolution for my sins. Then the Admiral commanded that a Priest should be brought unto him, The Priest being come, said unto <hi>Valentine,</hi> Now confess you unto me. <hi>Valentine</hi> getting the Priest aside, and being together, he said thus unto him: Sir, you are a Christian Priest, and above
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:150341:29"/> all other, you ought most to defend the Christian Faith, wherefore hearken to that I shall tell you, for it is a thing requireth great secresie. Thus it is, You know that this day I am to just with the heathenish Admiral, the greatest enemy of Christian People: now I am well assured, that a great number of the <hi>

                  </hi> will issue forth of the City, to be eye-witnesses of these Iusts, to be held without the walls of the City. Therefore you shall give warning to all Christians to keep within the walls, arming themselves in a readiness, and closely keep it from the ears of the Pagans: so when the Pagans are come forth to behold these Iusts the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians suddenly shall surprize the Guards that kéep the Gates and if any mutany arise, let them keep out those that are out. And send a Messenger to King <hi>Pepin</hi> of what is done, that he with his Army may come upon them that are without, while those within are set on by the armed Christians, so begirting them on every side, that in the end we may make such a slaughter on them, that the Christians may receive both their City in peace, and their former liberty. So having ended his spéech, the Priest departed. Then the Admiral commanded <hi>Valentine</hi> to be led into his Chamber to dine, giving them charge he should be honourably attended at the board. Being set among many Lords, he behaved himself gently and mildly towards all. Dinner being done, the Admiral called unto him a Nephew of his, named <hi>Salatas,</hi> commanding him to sée <hi>Valentine</hi> as well armed at all points as himself, and moreover charged his Nephew to deliver unto <hi>Valentine</hi> the best horse in his stable. <hi>Salatas</hi> having received this command from his Vncle the Admiral, took <hi>Valentine</hi> and led him into a fair Hall: being come thither, he caused to be laid before him divers Armors, willing him to make choice of the best: <hi>Valentine</hi> cast his eyes upon them all, and at last appointed the Armor wherewith he would be armed, and making himself ready as fast as he could, he approached down into the outer Court, whereas he was attended with his horse, ready to put his foot into the stirrup. Being come down out of the Hall, he presently mounted his horse, the Admiral issued likewise ready armed out of his privy Palace. Being thus armed, they took their way towards the chief Gate of the City of <hi>Rome,</hi> for on that side King <hi>Pepin</hi> had said his siege.</p>
               <pb n="50" facs="tcp:150341:30"/>
               <p>When they were both in the field, <hi>Valentine</hi> hung his Shield about his neck, in which he wore a Hart wavy in a field of silver, and on one side of the Hart a Tree, all which did signifie that he was found in a Forrest, and were the same Arms King <hi>Pepin</hi> bestowed on him. The Champions being entred the Lists, great was the clamour of the <hi>French,</hi> in joy of <hi>Valentine,</hi> the found whereof the Pagans hearing, suddenly issued forth out of the City, to behold these Triumphant Iusts. The Fryer having plaid his part among the Christians within the City, presently after the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans were gone out to behold these Triumphs, addressed himself to take possesson of the gates, which having gotten, there was no entrance again to be expected. King <hi>Pepin</hi> being made acquainted with their purpose, prepared all his men of War ready to relieve <hi>Valentine,</hi> if necessity required. Having now all things in readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, the hour was at hand that the Iusts should begin.</p>

               <p>So each of them being prepared for the encounter, they valiant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly couched their spears, and the first course proved so valiant, that their Spears shivered all in splinters: each Combatant percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving valour to brandish on the top of his Helm, made out a second course, where <hi>Valentine</hi> got the better, for with his Spear (charg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed against the breast of the Admiral) he gave him such a strong blow, that he forced his spear quite through his body, insomuch that he fell from his horse stark dead, making a pitiful noise at his departure, wherefore the Pagans ran suddenly upon <hi>Valentine,</hi> and would have killed him. <hi>Valentine</hi> perceiving their intent, with a resolute courage put Spurs to his Horse, and with his Sword drawn, violently rushed through the thickest of the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans, and slew many of them, as he passed through them. King <hi>Pepin</hi> also, with his Host came up to the aid of <hi>Valentine,</hi> but he was so hard beset by the Pagans, that he was smitten from off his Horse, which <hi>Valentine</hi> espying came up to the rescue of the King, so that he horsed him again.</p>
               <p>The King perceiving himself delivered out of danger, called unto <hi>Valentine,</hi> and said: My Child, thou hast saved my life, which if the Gods grant to spare, I will reward thee liberally. By this time the Battel grew so hot, that the Pagans were forced to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire to the City, when they came to the gates, the Christians that were in the City issued on them, and placed the Ensigns and Standards of King <hi>Pepin</hi> on the Walls. The Pagans seeing King <hi>Pepins</hi> Colours displayed upon the walls, betook themselves to slight: in chase of them the Christians followed on so fast, that they shamefully ended their days. In this Battel were slain a 1000 Pagans, only by the means of <hi>Valentine,</hi> who bare himself so vali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>antly that day, that he was the death of four Horses at the least. And thus by his prowess, the City was again restored to the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians, for which deed, there was great triumph in all Christen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, but especially at <hi>Rome,</hi> so that all the Inhabitants round about, gave everlasting praise to <hi>Pepin</hi> King of <hi>France,</hi> and by the general applause of the people, he was sacred Emperor, and Crowned by the Pope. King <hi>Pepin</hi> did many goodly acts in his time, administring Iustice to all. And this hapned in the time of Pope <hi>Clement</hi> the fourth.</p>

Valentine</hi> replyed: Madam, I can hinder no man to speak what pleaseth him; but as for my self, I have done little deserving praise, but it hath pleased the King your Father to do me great honour, even so much, as all the days of my life I am not able to make the least part of recompence: and as he spake these words, <hi>Haufray</hi> and <hi>Henry,</hi> (two men composed of all envy) entred the Chamber of <hi>Eglantine:</hi> and séeing him, began thus to speak: <hi>Valentine,</hi> what have you to do here in the Chamber of our Sister? it is no place for such Straglers as you are: this your boldness is not to be born: no man knows of whom you are; therefore we ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vise you to be warned, that you attempt not the like again, least you dearly buy these your presumptions: <hi>Valentine</hi> hearing these words, answered: Wrong me not, for I entred not the Chamber of your Sister, to her dishonour. What though I be poor, and not known of whence I am. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

               <p>

Dinner being finished, the King arose and called to <hi>Valentine,</hi> and in hearing of all his Nobles thus began to say: My Lords, here is <hi>Valent<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ne,</hi> that hath well-deserved at our hands, and that saved my life when I was in danger; therefore to the end you may take knowledge of his good service towards me, I fréely give unto him the Earldom of <hi>Clerimont</hi> of <hi>Avergne,</hi> and when I can bestow more upon him, he shall not be forgotten. <hi>Valentine</hi> gave him many thanks, saying, that he had heaped upon him more honours then he could any way deserve. <hi>Haufray</hi> and <hi>Henry</hi> hearing these words grew greatly male-content, and at last <hi>Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi> began to talk with his Brother on this manner: This found fellow, I perceive, grows in great favour with the King, and there must be some course taken to cross his designs, or else our over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw will shortly follow upon it; for (quoth he) you know well that the King hath no Sons but we two, and one little one (named <hi>Charlemain</hi>) which if our Father dye, may by our furtherance quickly be set beside the Kingdom. Again it is greatly to be feared, that this <hi>Valentine</hi> will support and uphold him against us. Therefore brother, I think if good to frame some plot against him, to bring him in displeasure with the King, and so far to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secute our revenge against him, that if it be possible, we will not onely work his down-fal, but life and all. This being effected, we may at our pleasure govern the Realm without contradiction. He having ended his speech, <hi>Haufray</hi> replyed; Let it be as thou hast said; and that we may entrap his life, this shall be our plot; We will both go to the King, and tell him, that this up-start hath de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flourd our Sister, and that we took him in bed with her, which, when the King heareth, will surely put him to death. Being thus resolved, they daily fed their imaginations with the death of <hi>Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lentine,</hi> while he (nothing mistrusting) served the King daily in all duty, insomuch that the Kings love daily encreased toward him; and above all other most desired his company.</p>
               <pb n="54" facs="tcp:150341:32"/>
               <p>Here let us leave off a little, and come to <hi>Orson</hi> his Brother, who all this while lived in the Forrest, so much feared of all men, that none durst approach nigh the wood. Daily complaints came unto the King from every side, and amongst the rest it chanced on a day, that a poor man came unto the King all wounded, saying thus unto him: Sir, I am come before you to make complaint a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst a Wild-man in the woods, for one day, as I and my wife passed through the Forrest, carrying bread and other victuals, the wild-man came upon us, took it away, and eat it every bit, and more then that, he violently took my wife from me, and constrained her to yield unto his lawless lust. The King hearing out the poor mans tale, was disposed to make himself merry with his ill for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, and thereupon asked the poor man this question: Whether griev'd him most, either the taking away of his victuals, or his wife: By my faith, said the poor man, at the wrong offered to my wife. Thou hast rightly said (quoth the King:) therefore I com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand my Treasurer to see restitution made unto thee, for the loss of thy victuals, but as for thy wife, thou must bare the burden thereof thy self.</p>
               <p>After this the King called all his Barons to assemble, and take some order to take this <hi>Orson,</hi> all which they did; and hereupon a Proclamation was sent unto all parts of the Realm, that whoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever he was, that could take this wild-man alive, or dead, should have a thousand marks for his reward. Hereupon assembled many worthy Knights to take this task in hand, but the King being one day in his Palace, in the midst of his Nobles, talking and debating who should be appointed to this business, <hi>Haufray</hi> (ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my unto <hi>Valentine</hi>) being there, said thus unto the King: Sir, here is <hi>Valentine,</hi> whom you have nourished, and advanced to high dignities, and one that hath offered unlawful love to our Sister <hi>Eglantine:</hi> He were fittest to set forward to try his valour, and let him be imployed to fetch in this Wild-man, that is such a terror to the Inhabitants: and if by his valour he can vanquish him, then let him have <hi>Eglantine</hi> in Marriage, which is his desired wish. The King hearing these words of his Son; said; Away, for thy speech savoureth of nothing but envy. What though he be poor, of low birth, and found in a Forrest, yet I find him to me true, and
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:150341:32"/> trusty, and of Gentile carriage, and to me seemeth to be born of a more noble parentage, than thou art: Leave off these thy malici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and bitter speeches against him; for the behaviour that dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth in him, shews that he is descended of a more Nobler linage, then as yet to us appeareth. And I for my part (for the divers vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues that daily are seen in him) am willing that he go to my daughter when ever he please, for I am well assured, that no disho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour can be offered out of a branch of such a generous spirit.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Haufray</hi> hearing the King make this Apology on the behalf of <hi>Valentine,</hi> was sore displeased in heart, but setting a good face up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the matter, dissembled his countenance for that time, but it seemed <hi>Valentine</hi> well observed him, and at last brake forth into these words: <hi>Haufray,</hi> without any cause given on my part, ye have spoken ill of me, and your will it is, that I should undertake the fight and conquest of the Wild-man, only to this end, that I might end my days, and so your revenge be accomplished upon me: Well, be it so, here before the King, I take a solemn Oath, that I will take the enterprize upon me, and find out the Wild-man, and having found him, I will fight with him, and either bring him alive or dead, or else leave my dead carcass as a witness in the open field. But if I conquer and live, I will never more be seen in this Country, till I have found the Father that begot me, as also, bring to light whether I was lawfully begotten in Wed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lock, and how I came to be left an infant in the wood.</p>
               <p>The King understanding well what danger <hi>Valentine</hi> had plunged himself into, grew excéeding angry against his two sons, cursing them, for that they were the cause of this dangerous en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprize: for he loved <hi>Valentine</hi> more then any, and at last called unto <hi>Valentine,</hi> and said: My Child, advise you well what you un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake, for with the Wild-man to fight is desperation it self, you cannot be ignorant how many valiant men, and worthy Champi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, have b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> him been overcome: and others likewise of valiant account that have forsaken this Combat. Therefore I say, let not the evil words of a few malicious men, make you desperate in lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing your life. For, my Child, it is far better to indure all the bitter words of envy (which is accounted vertue) then to hazard ones life against such a monster, and no man.</p>
               <pb n="56" facs="tcp:150341:33"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>Valentine</hi> replyed, Pardon me (my Leige) for I will never re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boke my intended purpose: They call me found brat, which grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth my very soul, for indeed I know not what I am, nor of what place, but I rest determined, and so take my leave; for to morrow morning will I set forward to my intended enterprize. Having taken his leave, marvel not, though the fair Lady <hi>Eglantine</hi> made great lamentation for what had hapned, but the next morning by break of day, she called one of her Maidens, and said; Go unto <hi>Valentine,</hi> and bid him come and speak with me before his depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, bid him fear no danger of life, for I would fain take my leave of him. The Damosel did as the Lady commanded, and when she came to <hi>Valentine,</hi> she found him mounted on horse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>back, and she did her Message unto him. He understanding her errand, said unto her, Damosel, I know the love to be great be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twéen my Lady <hi>Eglantine</hi> and me, yet I would not wish her to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire that would turn to her dishonour. But envy is of so great power, that it never leaves them whom it once possesseth. For cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain it is, that <hi>Haufray</hi> &amp; <hi>Henry</hi> (Brethren to your Lady) have at me great and malicious hearts, and will pursue me, even unto death (if it be possible) wherefore fair Damosel, bare her this an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer, which you heard me tell, and bid her think no evil thereof; and further, that she hold me in excuse, that I refuse to come; and so farewel.</p>

So he rode forth all that day, seeking the Wild-man, but he could not find him, so the night drawing on, he descended from his horse, and tyed him
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:150341:33"/> up unto a tree: having so done, he refreshed his body with such victuals as he had brought with him: and when he had eaten, &amp; the day shut in, <hi>Valentine</hi> for fear betook him to a top of a tree, and there abode al that night. In the morning so soon as day appeared he looked round about, &amp; at last espyed his Brother <hi>Orson</hi> runing through the Forrest: At length when he came to the place where <hi>Valentine</hi> had tyed his horse, the Wild man still drawing nearer unto him, wondring at the beauty of the horse began to claw him with his long nails, thinking to rouze up the courage of the horse, for he had never seen the like. The horse feeling the Wild mans nails scratching his side, began to fling and kick exceedingly, <hi>Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lentine</hi> siting in the top of a tree, noted the terrible shape of the Wild man, and began to be afraid, but calling on the Gods, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quested their aid against this Monster. <hi>Orson</hi> all this while was still busied in beholding this horse, and still offering him such in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury with his nails, that the horse did nothing but kick and bite him. When <hi>Orson</hi> perceived the Horse to be too hard for him, he caught fast hold on the horse, that he thought to cast him over, and fight with him. <hi>Valentine</hi> perceiving his horse in danger to be slain, he cryed out aloud, and said, Wild man, leave my Horse, and stay but till I come down, and with me thou shalt have fight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing enough. The Wild man hearing a strange voice, looked up into the tree, &amp; espying there a man, made unto him divers signs with his hands and head to come down and he would pull him in peices. <hi>Valentine</hi> making all the hast he could, drew his sword, &amp; leapt upon the Ground close by the Wild man; when <hi>O son</hi> saw the Sword, and that he offered to smite him therewith, he leaped and kept him from the stroak, but suddenly returned back again upon <hi>Valentine,</hi> and threw him unto the ground. Herewithal <hi>Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lentine</hi> was very much discomfited, for he looked for no other than present death in that place, for he felt the sttength of the Wild-man so great, that he had no hope of escaping.</p>
               <p>Being thus both Grovelling on the Ground, <hi>Valentine</hi> assaid divers times to have gotten <hi>Orson</hi> under him, but could not; when he saw that by strength there was no hope to overcome him, he drew out a sharp pointed knife, &amp; smote <hi>Orson</hi> deep into one of his sides: that the blood issued out abundantly. <hi>O<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="42" facs="tcp:150341:34"/> wounded, all inraged, he gave such a screech, that the Woods ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choed again at the sound thereof, but yet recovering himself, he so fiercely assaulted <hi>Valentine</hi> with his sharp nails, that he got him at such an advantage, that he threw him once more upon the earth, where lying they fought so long together, that it were too tedious here to utter. At last, <hi>Orson</hi> took the shield from about the neck of <hi>Valentine,</hi> and having got it, he beheld it right strangely, in regard of the divers colours thereon emblazed: when he had look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his fill he cast it against the ground, and suddenly returning again to <hi>Valentine,</hi> with the violence of his nails and teeth, he brake in peices both the ribs of his Armor, and his Habergoon al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so smiting and beating him so sharply with his nails, that he made the blood follow in all places wheron he laid hold. <hi>Valen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine</hi> feeling himself sore wounded, after some Orisons used to the Gods, he made again upon <hi>Orson</hi> with his Sword, thinking to have smitten him, but <hi>Orson</hi> reco<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

               <p>
                  <hi>Orson</hi> understanding by signs that he would his good, fell down upon his knees, and stretched forth his hands towards his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, making unto him signs to forgive him, and he would com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit himself under his command ever after, and with further signs
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:150341:34"/> promised, that during his life, he would assist him both in body &amp; goods. This happening thus, it was great joy to <hi>Valentine,</hi> in that he had conquered the Wild man, which so many Knights durst not meddle withal: for by this onely he had won himself more honour than any Knight that lived in <hi>France</hi> in those days. All this hard adventure now knitting up in this manner, he took <hi>Orson</hi> by the hand, and shewed him by signs, that he should go on before him ti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="60" facs="tcp:150341:35"/> night, he would let loose the Wild man amongst them, still he proceeded to intreat for lodging, but none would give it him. At last, as he had threatned, so he did, and letting loose the Wild man he made him signs how he should run against such a Gate, which was an Inn, the which he did, wringing a post from out of the earth, he ran against the Gate, smiting it open with such violence, that they fell of the hooks upon the ground. <hi>Valentine</hi> seeing the Gate opened in this manner, entred the house, and the Wildman with him: But when they within saw the Gate broken down they all forsook the house, and ran out at the back door, leaving all to <hi>Valentine</hi> and his beast y Guest. <hi>Valentine</hi> perceiving them all fled, went to the Stable, and set up his horse, and dressed him: and <hi>Orson</hi> in the mean time went into the Kitchin, where there was Capons and divers other provisions of flesh upon a spit roasting at the fire. <hi>Valentine</hi> made signs to <hi>Orson,</hi> that he should turn the spit, but so soon as <hi>Orson</hi> understood his meaning, he set his horny tallons upon the meat, and tore it from the spit, devouring it as greedily as a ravenous Wolf: when he had torn the meat in peices, he espyed a Caldron of water standing by, into which he put his head like a Horse, and drank water unmeasurably. <hi>Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lentine</hi> perceiving him to be a thirst made signs unto him, that he should forsake the water, and he would give him Wine, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withal took a pot, and led him into the Seller: when <hi>V<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="2 letters">

But in regard he would make a further tryal of him, he punched against him with his foot so hard that it awaked him: being awa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, he made signs unto him, that there was people about the house: with that <hi>Orson</hi> suddenly arose as in a trance, and catching at a great log within the Chimney, he ran against the Gate of the house, that he made all shake again: at which sudden action; <hi>Valentine</hi> fell into a great laughter, which <hi>Orson</hi> perceiving, let all alone, and betook himself to his rest again. <hi>Valentine</hi> made un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him another sign, that he should fear nothing, for he would be his watch-man, but <hi>O<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

               <p>The Inhabitants of the City perceiving the Wild man, ran every man into his house, shutting their doors, and getting up into their higher rooms, gazing out of their windows.

<pb n="64" facs="tcp:150341:37"/> which they were right sorroy. At last <hi>Valentine</hi> opened unto them his meaning, which was, that he would gladly kiss and play with some of them, whereat they looked one upon another and began to laugh. While this assembly of the Ladies chanced in the Chamber of <hi>Eglantine; Haufray</hi> came to <hi>Henry</hi> and said thus unto him: Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; you see how the honor and credit of this foundling increseth, which much eclipseth our honor, and we must seek some remedy for it. It is true (said <hi>Henry</hi>) wherefore let us lay some plot to cut him off. Then said <hi>Henry,</hi> hearken what I shall say, <hi>Valentine</hi> is now with our Sister, and we may have fit occasion to kill him in her Chamber, when we have done, we will inform the K. that we found him in her bed. According to their determination they put it in action, and rushed into the Chamber of <hi>Eglantine.</hi> Assoon as <hi>Haufray</hi> was entred, he roughly thus began with <hi>Valentine.</hi> Disloyal man, now shalt thou know the price of thy inconstancy, purchasing daily great dishonor unto the K. our Father, by abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing our sister <hi>Eglantine,</hi> and leading her affections to work your pleasure on her, insomuch as by thee she is made unfortunate. But sith the King hath been told hereof, &amp; he regardeth not our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint, it is therefore high time to take vengeance of thee in our own persons. And <hi>Haufray</hi> lift up his fist and calling him Traitor, smote <hi>Valentine</hi> on the face, so that the blood ran out of his mouth, <hi>Henry</hi> on the other side came to him, and with a Glave thought to have smitten <hi>Valentine</hi> to the earth. <hi>Orson</hi> perceiving they were in earnest, leapt out, and gave <hi>Haufray</hi> such a stroak with his rough hand that he felled him, &amp; after ran to <hi>Henry,</hi> and girded him so be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween his arms, that if the Ladys had not been in presence to have appeased his wrath, he had destroyed them both at once.</p>
               <p>At this became an outcry in the Chamber, whereat came all the Barons of the Court, to know the cause of this sudden clamor, but when they understood that <hi>Orson</hi> dealt so violently with the Kings Sons, they would have killed him with their swords. <hi>V<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

The King hearing this complaint, was exceeding sorry, and gave them this answer, that as for <hi>Orson,</hi> he would have him put into a strong Tower, where he should be safely kept, &amp; not come abroad without leave given him, &amp; as for <hi>Valentine,</hi> the King sent for him to demand the cause of this disor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der. <hi>Valentine</hi> being come before the King, began to say on this manner: Dread Soveraign, I was in the Chamber of your daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter <hi>Eglantine</hi> accompanied with divers other Ladies, that desired to see <hi>Orson,</hi> I know not how nor why your two sons <hi>Haufray</hi> and <hi>Henry,</hi> violently entred the chamber, charging me that I had abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed the body of your fair daughter, morever, in the heat of their violence used against me, <hi>Haufray</hi> smote me on the face, that the blood issued, and <hi>Henry</hi> lifting up his Sword, thought to have ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken away my life. All which, when <hi>Orson</hi> saw, he suddenly made towards them, and smote them both to the earth, and therewithal began this uprore. The King hearing this tale, said: And is this true that you have said? Vpon my life (said <hi>Valentine</hi>) all that I have spoken is true. Then said the King, <hi>Orson</hi> hath done nothing but right, and that which in duty he ought to do. And as for you <hi>Haufray</hi> and <hi>Henry,</hi> I see right well that you are even swolen full of malice against <hi>Valentine:</hi> wherefore I charge you from hence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forth, that you attempt no ill against him, for here I vow, that I would not lose him for the best Baron in my Land, for I have made many tryals of his love and faithfulness towards me: and with this answer <hi>Haufray</hi> and <hi>Henry</hi> departed, although sorrowful in heart, that they could not work their wills upon him.</p>
               <p>They being gone, <hi>Valentine</hi> stayed still in the Kings Hall a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst the other Nobles that were there assembled, and <hi>Orson</hi> went here and there round about the Palace, at last he came unto the Kitchin where the Cooks were making ready supper, and being there, he espyed two Capons, ready for the Fire, <hi>Orson</hi> made towards the Capons, and set upon them, eating them up raw like a hungry Dog. The Cook seeing him eat up his Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons, took a Pestel lying by him, and gave <hi>Orson</hi> such a blow
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:150341:38"/> that he made him bow therewith. <hi>Orson</hi> feeling the blow, stooped down, and took the Cook up between the legs, throwing him down upon the Ground, and being down, he so be laboured the poor Cook, that he had well nigh beat him to death. Tydings was brought unto the Kin that <hi>Orson</hi> had slain the Cook, and none durst come near him.</p>
               <p>The King hearing hereof, willed him to be brought before him and made signs unto him, that he should be hanged: but <hi>Orson</hi> fetched the Pestel, and made signs how the Cook had beaten him therewith, wherefore the King commanded that none should offer him any injury. So after that, <hi>Valentine</hi> taught him manners, how he should behave himself. And so they both lived quietly in the Court of King <hi>Pepin.</hi>

               <head>CHAP. XVI. How Duke Savary sent unto King Pepin for aid against the Green Knight, who would have his Daughter in Marriage against his will.</head>
               <p>IT chanced that not long after the coming home of <hi>Valentine</hi> and <hi>Orson</hi> into the Court of King <hi>Pepin,</hi> that Duke <hi>Savary</hi> sent certain Messengers to K. <hi>Pepin,</hi> which said to him on this manner: Great King, our good Duke hath sent us unto you, to request your aid against a false and accursed Pagan (called the Green Knight) who hath besieged his Confines, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendeth to have his Daughter by force of arms against his will, notwithstanding all the resistance that he and his three Sons can make against him. The King having heard this Message, made this answer: We agree to give him all the aid we can. He had no sooner given answer unto these Messengers, but there was come unto the Court another Messenger from <hi>Lyons,</hi> who after his du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty done unto the King, said thus unto him: Renowned King as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semble your men of War in readiness, and conduct them towards

                  <hi>Lyons,</hi> for the <hi>Almains</hi> are coming against you in great numbers, their whole force consisting of above an hundred thousand fighting men. The King hearing this sudden news, was much troubled, in mind: and presently called before him the Arch-Bishop of <hi>Rhemes,</hi> the Duke <hi>Myllon Daugler, Gar<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>s</hi> and <hi>Sampson,</hi> these with others of his Nobles being assembled, he declared what the Messenger had said, and withal craved their Counsel what was best to be done, whether to go to <hi>Aquitain</hi> to succor Duke <hi>Sava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,</hi> or to <hi>Lyons,</hi> to resist the <hi>Almains,</hi> whereunto <hi>Millon Daugler</hi> made this answer: The Duke I confess deserveth to be succour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed but yet in two extreams, let us chuse the less: Therefore I judge it most meet, first to defend our own Land, that is now in present danger: and for the Duke, he must be content to take our present affairs for answer: so Generally it was concluded to go for <hi>Lyons.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>With these words the Messenger that came from the Duke of <hi>Savary</hi> departed, and carried these tydings with him to <hi>Aquitain,</hi> which made him very sorrowful to hear it, because the Green Knight had very strongly assailed him. Now here gentle Reader I let you understand, for the better ordering our proceeding, that this Green Knight here spoken of, was brother to <hi>Ferragus,</hi> the Gyant that kept the Lady <hi>Bellyfant</hi> in his Castle, who was the distressed mother of these two Infants, born in the Wood, called <hi>Valentine</hi> and <hi>Orson,</hi> as is before declared. Duke <hi>Savary</hi> percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving no hope of aid from King <hi>Pepin,</hi> made open Proclimation throughout all his Dominions, that all, of what condition soever, should be ready armed against the morow after, for he would then go out upon the Green Knight, and Fight with him in the Field, all which was accordingly performed. The day appointed being come, both armies met, as well Horse as Foot, the Pagan<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented themselves in multitudes &amp; the Green Kt. behave him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self so valiantly, that the first encounter, with his Battel-Ax at two blows he slew two valiant Knights. Duke <hi>Savary</hi> perceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him to be so warlike a General, came up to encounter him, and meeting, they assailed each other, but the Duke was ill-advi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed to adventure his body against the Green Knight, because it was ever peremptorily reported of him, that he should never be
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:150341:39"/> overcome of any, except he were a Kings Son, and such a one as had never sucked the breasts of any woman. But the Green Kt. was herein deceived, for he thought it impossible any such man should be upon the face of the earth: but it fell out contrary to his expectation, as you shall understand. Let us now return to the two valiant leaders, who fought long and fiercely, but the Duke ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tured so far into the enemies hands, that when he had thought to have retired; he could not, for he was round begirt with such mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titudes of Pagans, that he was taken prisoner, and brought back unto the Green Knight, whose Ransom could not be Granted for any Gold or Treasure. His men at Arms perceiving the Duke surprized, returned to <hi>Acquitain,</hi> sore lamenting the loss of their good Duke. And his three Sons, <hi>Garin</hi> the elder, <hi>Anselmne</hi> and <hi>Garin</hi> the younger, made great moan to see the hard hap of their Father, led captive among the Pagans.</p>
               <p>The Sons having shewed their sorrows, in comes <hi>Fezon</hi> his Daughter with this lamenting out-cry, Alas: in an ill hour was I born, seeing that so many valiant Knights and Gentlemen have suffered death in my quarrel, and yet there is one thing more troubleth my distempered soul than all the rest, which is this, that my Father should be held captive in the hands of his Enemies, the onely way to bring his aged years with sorrow to the Grave. Alas (dear Father) your love to me is the onely cause of all these disasterous chances. Thus fell <hi>Fezon</hi> into a dangerous fit of dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>content, insomuch, as with this extremity of sorrow, she had well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nigh finished her days, had not the rest of the Ladies attendant, laboured to comfort her in this great sorrow, wherewith she was almost overcome.</p>
               <p>Whilst the Lady was thus oppressed with sorrow, the Green Kt. triumphed over the worthy Duke, causing him to be brought before him into his Pavilion, and having him there, began to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vile him in this disdainful manner: Duke, now thou perceivest that thou art my Vassal and that I have power over thy life: this that I speak thou canst not deny: therefore let me tell thee what thou shalt expect from my sacred lips: either give me thy Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter <hi>Fezon</hi> to Wife, and so redeem thy life, or else I will have her against thy will, leading her amongst rough Mountains, and
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:150341:39"/> there royally Crown her Queen of those craggy Mansions.</p>
               <p>The Duke hearing these proud menaces, began thus to reply: Proud and insolent Sarazen, know this, that I will never give consent that thou have my Daughter except thou also subscribe to be baptized. The Green Knight hearing him say so, replyed: Vrge me no further, for I am wholly bound to <hi>Mahomet:</hi> Wherefore once again I tell thee, except thou yeild to my demand I wil first make thee finish thy days miserably, and afterward consume all <hi>Acquitain</hi> to ashes, and after that put to the Sword all that come in my way, men, women, and Ch<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ldren. The Duke hearing this Pagan thus resolute, began again on this manner: Pagan, the Gods protect me from thy cruelty, for I had rather rely on their power then thine. The Green Knight hearing him say so, began wistly to set his eye upon him, &amp; marking his unwonted lamenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, began a fresh with him on this manner: grave Duke, leave off these thy sad laments, and hearken unto my relation and reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution also, and this it so: I am not ashamed to let thee under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand, that thy Daughters beauty hath enthralled me, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I will recal my threatned Sentence of death against thee: Out of which Captivate affections towards thy Daughter, I am forced to yeild to this condition, that thou shalt find out a Knight within the space of six months, to encounter me, and if so it hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen that by strength of Arms he conquer me, I vow by all the Heavens, to send thee back again into thy own country, without wasting any of the same: but if it happen, that I p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

               <p>These Agreements thus concluded, the Green Knight gave leave that Duke <hi>Savary</hi> should depart, upon Conditions, that he should swear to keep covenants, not only for the present, but du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring his life. The Duke being thus delivered, made his repair to <hi>Aq<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

This <hi>Lampatris</hi> was King of <hi>Syres, Holland,</hi> and <hi>Friezland,</hi> with the Country of <hi>Monemarch,</hi> in the which stood a very strong defenced City, whereunto they withdrew themselves. King <hi>Pepin</hi> getting knowledge hereof, strongly begirt this City with a siege, insomuch that at last they were constrained to yeild or suffer famishment, but resolving upon the safety of their lives, they yeilded their City, which City the King bestowed upon <hi>Guy,</hi> Marshal of <hi>France.</hi> The wars being ended, <hi>Pepin</hi> returned again into <hi>France,</hi> with all his warlike Souldiers: Being arrived at <hi>Paris,</hi> it was told him that Duke <hi>Savary</hi> had taken truce with the Green Kt. and the manner how, whereat the K. laughing heart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily, said in the presence of his Barons: who is he amongst you that would win fair <hi>Fezon</hi> for his Love, must take upon him a Combate against the Green Knight, whom if he conquer &amp; over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come, the Duke will not onely give him his Daughter, but one half of his possessions: and that this is true, behold Letters here
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:150341:40"/> written with his own hand. Every one of these worthy Knights right diligently vewed these Letters, yet none of them durst un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake the enterprize, save onely <hi>Valentine,</hi> who perceiving them all refuse it, said thus unto the King: Right dear Soveraign, if it please you to give me leave, I will adventure my strength upon that Green Knight, and will gladly undertake the task commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Again, I have a great desire to leave <hi>France,</hi> for I long to take in hand some tedious journey, to find out the Mother that bear me, and from whence I am descended. <hi>Valentine</hi> (said the King take thou no care of whence thou art, for it resteth in my power to make thee greater than any man within my Court, and for that I find thee willing to go to <hi>Aquitain.</hi> I freely give thee leave, but on condition, that after thou hast tryed thy Man-hood with the Green Knight, thou return again, if thou escape with life. <hi>Valentine</hi> yeilded to the King in his demand, and so taking leave, he shortly after prepared to his journey.</p>

               <p>Lady (quoth he) Silver and Gold need I none, but that which most of all destempereth my unquiet Breast, is, that I cannot learn of my discent. Moreover: one thing more troubleth me as much as the other, which is, that I bear upon one of my should<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers a Cross, and it is of the colour of most pure Gold, of which sign I know not what to gather, but resolve thus, never to rest in any place, until such time as I have found out the truth of my

<pb n="74" facs="tcp:150341:42"/> blood, and considering how he was encompassed with a multitude of his enemies, recommending his innocency unto the Gods, and at last spoke on this manner: My Lords (speaking to <hi>Haufray</hi> and <hi>Henry</hi>) I see well that you have determined my days by Treason, and that without cause on my part given, but yet I assure you, that before I yield my self into your hands, or before this days Sun be set, I shall send some of you here present into such a Coutry, that you shall scarcely ever return again to bring tydings of your Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour. And therewithal drew forth his sword, and gave the first that encountred him such a blow upon the head, that he clave it even to his teeth, and there he lay dead: After that he betook him to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the rest, with such violence, that at every stroak one fell before him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Orson</hi> perceiving his Brother thus to lay about him, began to rouze himself, and with his rough hands and piercing tallons, he rent and tore all that came in his way, and so bit them with his téeth, that they fell groveling unto the ground one upon another, where he trampled over them like dirt, pinching them with his feet. <hi>Valentine</hi> seeing his brother <hi>Orson</hi> thus bestir himself, held up his bloody sword, defending himself, and offending his enemies so valiantly, that they all forsook them, and durst not stay within their sight: <hi>Grygar</hi> their Captain, perceiving all his men thus pittifully killed and overcome, cryed out with a loud voice on this manner. <hi>Valentine,</hi> yet I wish thee yeild, or else look for nothing but death. <hi>Valentine</hi> hearing these insulting words, made toward <hi>Grygar,</hi> and in a fierce and furious manner assailed him; but being too forward, he plunged himself into the throng, that he was en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>closed round about, kéeping off <hi>Orson</hi> with their long spears. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thus begirt about with enemies, he still behaved himself so va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liantly, that not any man durst lay hold upon him, till at last they gathered in so close upon him, that he was overcome with multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes, and being not able longer to weild his sword, they took him, bound him, and carry'd him away with strong hands. <hi>Orson</hi> percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving his Brother thus posted away, ran after, making a hideous noise, but he could not overtake them, for they rid away swifter than he could run, and having at last lost the sight of them, knew not which way he were best to take after. <hi>Grygar</hi> the Captain com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:150341:42"/> them to follow after <hi>Orson,</hi> and to bring him back, either alive or dead; out in vain they followed, for he out-ran them, and so escaped. Those that had the charge of <hi>Valentine,</hi> brought him to a Castle standing in the midst of a Forrest, kept by a notable Thief, who was Cousin German to <hi>Grygar; Valentine</hi> being entred the Castle Gate, they entreated him evilly, conveyed him to a deep Dungeon which grieved him to the heart, insomuch that his grief brast out into these words: Alas, now is that come upon me, which I ever feared, for I am fallen into the hands of my deadli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est enemies, and those that have ever sought my life, and utter destruction. Farewel Noble King <hi>Pepin,</hi> for I fear I shall never sée thee more, and that which most of all vexeth me, that thou never shalt understand the truth of my death, for the very stench of this ugly Dungeon doth even stop my breath. Farewel <hi>Orson</hi> too, for thou hast already suffered death for my sake, and more could no man do, even as much as if thou hadst been my natural Brother. Farewel my sweet Mother also, whom I have ever la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boured to find out, that I might sée and know her, but my hopes are all frustrated, for now I must dye without the knowledge of what Parentage I am descended. Thus <hi>Valentine</hi> lamented in the dark pit, whilst his enemies determine what shall be done to him: some were of opinion to put him to death, others, that he should be committed to a perpetual imprisonment. But <hi>Grygar</hi> being Lord over the rest, would not yield he should be put to death, but rather to keep him in prison till <hi>Haufray</hi> and <hi>Henry</hi> have received know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of all their proceedings. Having thus set down their resolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, they determined to take their journey towards <hi>Paris,</hi> where the King then lay, to meet with <hi>Haufray</hi> and <hi>Henry,</hi> who enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained them Royally, being right glad that <hi>Valentine</hi> was fallen into their hands by Treason. Now understand, that <hi>Orson</hi> all that night was fain to rest within the wood, lying down at the root of a Tree. The morning deing come, he took on his way towards <hi>Paris</hi> also, never resting till he came into the presence of King <hi>Pepin:</hi> Being come thither, by signs and tokens he shewed the manner of y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> taking of <hi>Valentine,</hi> but yet for all the hast he made, <hi>Grygar</hi> was arrived at the Court before him. <hi>Haufray</hi> and <hi>Henry</hi> were much grieved that <hi>Orson</hi> had escaped, but all their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort

Amongst the rest, at the last he lighted upon the Traitor <hi>Grygar,</hi> who espying <hi>Orson</hi> hung his head in his bosome. <hi>Orson</hi> having once got the sight of him, ran furiously upon him, and gave him such a sturdy stroak, that he smote off one of his ears: After he began to lay upon his face, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>somuch that he put out one of his eyes, and broke one of his téeth. <hi>Grygar</hi> being thus wounded, began to cry out for help, but <hi>Orson</hi> hearing him make such an uproar, ran again upon him, and gave him such another stroak, that he felled him unto the earth, over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throwing tables, meat, and all that stood before him; which drave all the beholders into admiration; and had he not been rescued by a valiant Prince that then sat at Board, he had never gone from that place alive: which Prince having rescued him, began to say unto the King on this manner: Mighty King, consider into what danger this man is fallen by the fury of this wild-man; and either let him dye for this presumptious fact, or no man will be able to come into your Court. The King hearing him say so: replyed, we will consider the cause, and as we find it, so will we proceed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst him. Bring him hither before us, that we may question the cause of this his fact. <hi>Orson</hi> was brought before the King, and he

K. <hi>Pepin</hi> perceiving by his action, the course of the matter, called forth unto all the Lords and Barons on this manner: My Lords, you sée as well as I, that this wild-man hath challenged <hi>Grygar,</hi> to fight with him, therefore tell me your opinions what is best to be done in this case, for I cannot chuse but marvel why this Wild-man should find out <hi>Grygar</hi> above all the rest of the Knights here as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembled: therefore let every man freely speak, for I much doubt some hidden secret to lye herein, and for my part I could willingly give consent that it should be tryed forth by combat betwéen them. When the King had thus uttered what he thought, the Barons agreed to the verdict that the King had passed. So the Battel was determined, and <hi>Grygar</hi> was brought before the King, to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent he should undergo the Challenge against the Wild-man: <hi>Grygar</hi> hearing what the King had determined, was very fearful and sad, and not without cause: for he fore-saw hereby, that his treason would come to light, and therewithal cast an ill-favoured eye on <hi>Haufray.

Having thus said, he left <hi>Henry,</hi> and returned unto the King: saying: Mighty King, let me make one request unto your Majesty, that you would dismiss me from this dangerous task, the reason chiefly mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving me, is, that insomuch that it is not man against man, whereby a Knight may win honour, but a wild savage to encounter with man, and that man no Knight. I think I may safely (so your Grace be pleased) refuse the Combat. Nay (quoth the King) no excuse in this case can be admitted, for the Combat is granted, not only by my advise, but also by the counsel of all my Barons, and the reason moving us so grant it, was, that treason long lying hid, might

               <p>When <hi>Orson</hi> gathered by his wonted signs, that he should fight with this Traitor, he was right glad, and withal made shews unto the King, <hi>Valentine</hi> was dead, whereat the King grew wondrous sad, and fain would <hi>Orson</hi> have been upon the back of <hi>Grygar,</hi> but that the King commanded him to be taken away, making signs unto him, that he should strike no more, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

Again, the King called unto <hi>Grygar,</hi> to make hast to arm himself: <hi>Grygar</hi> loath to ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture his life upon so uncertain ground, began once again to speak unto the King, saying: Most dread Soveraign, I have been a long servitor about your person both in war and peace, but you reward me not accordingly, insomuch as you compel me to fight against a man, that hath neither sence, reason, nor, in truth; humane shape: <hi>Grygar</hi> (said the King) if the truth be on your side, you need not fear, for you shall enter into the field well armed, and as for <hi>O<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                  <hi>Grygar</hi> being thus armed, and well mounted on his Horse, went towards the Palace Gate, where this Combat was to be effected: the hour being come, the King repaired to the window to behold the Combat: All the Nobles in the Court being assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled, the Iudges were appointed, that no wrong should be offered on either part. So <hi>Grygar</hi> being entred the Lists, he espyed <hi>Orson,</hi> and began to draw near unto him, saying:</p>
               <p>Villain, thou hast offered me great wrong, in putting out one of my eyes, but e're I part, I will make thée acknowledge that wrong: and that thou hast falsely accused me to the King. <hi>Orson</hi> perceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing whereunto his proud speeches tended, shewed him his nails, gnashing his teeth together at him: whereat <hi>Grygar</hi> suddenly cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched his Spear within his rest, and ran upon him. <hi>Orson</hi> espying the Spear bent against him, gave back, whereby <hi>Grygar</hi> was dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appointed of his mark, and ran his Spear fast into the ground; <hi>Orson</hi> taking this advantage, suddenly returned back again, seized the Spear into his own hands, and having hold thereof, gave his enemy such a stroak therewith, that he astonied him. <hi>Grygar</hi> féel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the fury of his stroak, set spurs to his horse, and rid like a mad man about the field: <hi>Orson</hi> ran after him with a grinning coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance, making signs to the King, that he would e're long force him to yeild unto him. <hi>Grygar</hi> fearing the danger wherein he was like to fall, secretly to himself murmured out these words: Ah <hi>Haufray,</hi> for thy cause and sake I am thus delivered over to death. Long and tedious was the fight, but <hi>Grygar</hi> could never so much as wound the Wild-man.</p>
               <p>At last <hi>Orson</hi> cast away his Spear, and came close to <hi>Grygar,</hi> in such manner, that he caught his horse fast by the neck, making him so mad and furious, that he overthrew his rider to the earth, and with the fall thereof he lost his Shield. <hi>Orson</hi> espying the Shield, took it up, and put it upon his own back; after he came unto <hi>Grygars</hi> Horse, and gat upon him, riding round about the Field, and making ill-favoured signs and tokens, insmuch, as all the beholders there present, stood as men dismayed. Amongst
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:150341:45"/> the rest, the King himself appeared very sorrowful, and at last be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan thus to speak: My Lords, I know not what to think hereof, neither can I yet perceive whereunto this fight will grow, but it is my opinion, that there is treason smothered, and not yet come to light. <hi>Orson</hi> having now a great while ranged about the Field on Horse-back after his enemy, at last forsook his horse, and encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred <hi>Grygar</hi> on foot, insomuch that he lent him such a blow that he smote him to the earth, afterward he leaped upon him, and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>armed him of his weapons: then the next blow he struck, he smote off one of his arms: next on the body he gave him such a wound, that it cut him even to the reins of the back. <hi>Grygar</hi> having re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived all these wounds, cryed out most pitifully, insomuch that every one requested he might have a Priest to confess him of his sins. The guard that was appointed for the field, hearing these out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crys, sent out a worthy Knight to demand what he would have done, unto whom <hi>Grygar</hi> said; Sir, bring me before the Kings Majesty, and before him and the rest ef his assembly I shall reveal the Treasons whereof I am guilty, from point to point effectually.</p>

But in that you urge, that your coming hither was only to Combat the Green Knight: come you into my Palace, and there you shall be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold the beauty for which you thus far adventured. Moreover, that you may see you are not come alone, you shall behold fifteen Knights to accompany you, and new arrived for the Love of the Lady <hi>Fezon,</hi> and to try their Valour against the said Green Knight their Enemy. Go, I say, to my Palace, and salute my Daughter, as my custom is to strangers, before they adventure their persons in battel with the Green Knight, and having pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented your selves before her in the sign of love, you shall receive from her a King of Gold.</p>
               <p>Sir, (quoth <hi>Valentine</hi>) I shall be ready to do all Rights and Customes belonging to this place; and besides, will obey you in all things whatsoever it shall please you to command me. This con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference ended, the Duke went into the Castle, accompanied with <hi>Valentine</hi> and <hi>Orson.</hi> Having entred the Hall where the Knights were assembled, <hi>Valentine</hi> beheld the Lady sitting amongst them, and making his way unto her, with all duty and reverence, at last he saluted her thus: Lady, you whose beauty and Fame is bruted through the world, the Gods preserve thee from the Green Knight, who I dare boldly avouch, is not worthy to touch your superexcellent lips. Moreover, dear Lady, may it please you to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand, that <hi>Pepin</hi> the mighty <hi>King</hi> of <hi>France</hi> hath sent us hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

Sir (quoth the Lady) I yield unto the King of <hi>France</hi> thousands of thanks, as also to you that have taken such pains to present such a one before me: But say, wherefore is this worthy Champion no better cloathed, for me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinks he is of an excellent Person, well formed, straight, and of a hardy countenance: and if he were washed and bathed in some excellent liquor, his flesh would be both white and soft. Lady (quoth <hi>Valentine</hi>) he never wore garment till it was very lately, and then I caused this Iacket you see him wear, to be made fitting to his body: Moreover I assure you, that when he came first into <hi>Pari<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

While he was speaking these words, <hi>Fezon</hi> beheld him very wistly; for she was in love with him in her heart: But yet <hi>Valentine</hi> began again thus to speak unto her; Lady, for my self I must say something also, therefore know this, that only for the love of you, have I adventured my self in this Climate, to see if fortune will so much favour me, that I may bear you away from all comers, by force of Arms: and yet fair Lady, one thing more I have to utter unto you, which is, that I have made an Oath unto my self, that I will never return again into <hi>France,</hi> till I have proved my fortune on the Green Knight, and with him do I intend to cope before I part hence; and either deliver him over into your hands as conquered; or suffer death, as man<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

The Duke answered, yea, I have yet within my Palace, sixteen valiant Knights, that mean to try their fortunes upon thée, before they part my Country. Then said the Green Knight, let me see them; and likewise the fair Lady <hi>Fezon:</hi> En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, said the Duke, for thou hast free liberty.

Now <hi>O son</hi> understood that <hi>Valentine</hi> spoke all this of him, and also knew this to be the Green Knight, by whom so many valiant men had lost their lives; insomuch that he saluted him with a fierce Visage, and whetting his teeth, leapt from the Table, and taking the G<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

               <p>At this sudden action of <hi>Orson,</hi> all the Knights there assembled began to laugh, and turning one towards another, said: Now is he come indeed, that shall be the overthrow of the Green Kn<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

By this time the Green Knight was again recovered, and counting it a deed of courage, began thus to say in the aforesaid presence: Lords, this Wild-man hath deceived my trust, for he came upon me at unawares, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out saying any word, but I think good to let you understand that in the morning I shall be better provided, and to the end I may make him an example to all that ever went before, I will ordain for him a Gibit of purpose, higher and stronger than for any that have been vanquished by me: and thereon will I hang his beastly corps, for Beasts and Birds to make their prey.</p>

Hereat the Green Knight feetted so exceeding<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that he replyed never a word. Duke <hi>Savary</hi> being present, said unto him; Sir Knight, I well perceive that the Battel will grow strong between the Wild-man and you, and I think that he will hold you tough play, wherefore if you chance to conquer him also, you may well report of your valour throughout the world, for he hath tryed some part of his courage already; and in vanquishing him, you need not stand in fear of any. The Green Knight hereat more and more enraged, swore by all the Gods, that e're the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row Sun was set, he would try the utmost of his strength, for he should never return again from the field, but he hanged a great deal higher than any of the rest: and with these words left the Castle, and betook him him to his Pavillion.</p>
               <p>He being departed, the rest of the Knights still remained with the Lady <hi>Fezon,</hi> making great joy, and saying one to another, that the day was come, that the Green Knight should meet with his match. On the other side, Fame had so spread abroad the worthy act of <hi>Orson</hi> the savage, upon the Green Knight, that multitudes of people resorted into the Palace, to see and behold him, inso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much that the Duke commanded the Gates to be shut against them. <hi>Orson</hi> perceiving the people so abundantly to approach, and hearing the noise, leapt up into a window, to behold the people, so that they willing to see him, and he desired to see them, at night they all departed to their houses. The people being departed, and supper ended, they passed the rest of the night in merriments, and so to bed. <hi>Valentine</hi> being brought to his Chamber, went to bed, making signs to <hi>Orson</hi> to lye down by him; but he not regarding his kindness, laid him down upon the ground according to his wounted use, and so passed away that night.

Hereupon he presently put himself in arms, and being armed, took his way towards the beautious La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, to take his leave, as it becomed him: being come before her, she grew wondrous sorrowful, and yet at last she spake unto him on this manner: Alas, fair Knight, what madness is this in you, to adventure your self for the love of such an unfortunate Lady as I? well, if thou wilt needs run into danger, go on, but I will in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocate the Gods to aid and assist thee against thine and mine ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my; and so farewel.</p>

As he was ready to put forth, he met with a worthy Knight, who was likewise enamoured with the love of the Lady, and thus began to say to him; Sir, have a little patience, I entreat you, and suffer me to go first. Friend (quoth <hi>Valentine</hi>) I freely grant your desire; go, and return with victory. This Knights name was <hi>Tyris</hi> born in <hi>Savoy,</hi> a man of great birth and living, but riotously had run through his means, leaving himself little, save only his Horse and Arms; having thus obtained leave of <hi>Valentine,</hi> he also took leave of the Lords there assembled, and so

Friend (quoth the Gréen Knight) shall I tell thee wherefore I sent thée thither; it was, for that this Shield was given unto me by a Fairy, and therein remaineth such vertue, that no man, be he never so strong, can take it from the place where it is fastned, save only he alone by whom I shall be overcome, and for the doubt I stood in of thee, therefore sent I thee thither: but now my doubt is fatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied,

By the Gods (quoth the Green Knight) then thou hast some secret treason to work against me, that thus thou runnest upon thy death wilfully, but e're I part with thee, I will make thee know the price of this thy rashness, and therewithal leapt upon his horse, bidding one of his servants to bring unto him a box of precious balm, the vertue of it was such that what wound soever he received, though never so mortal, it had power instantly to heal up the breach, as divers times be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he had made tryal of the same.</p>
               <p>After he had received the box of Ointment, he suddenly put spurs to his horse, and couching his spear in his rest both ran their course so furiously that their spears brake in many pieces: so bend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing themselves to the next course, they valiantly drew out their swords, whereat <hi>Valentine</hi> behaved himself so nimbly, that he gave the Green <hi>Kt.</hi> so fell a stroak that he cut him through his Armour, insomuch that the blood issued out in great abundance. The Gréen Knight feeling himself wounded, lift up his arm to fetch a blow, that he struck away a great piece of his thigh, and having thus wounded him, said unto him: You may see I can wield a sword as well as you, I told you before, that you will fall under my hand, and anon I shall be fain to hang up your dead corps on a tree as I

The Gréen Knight being thus unarmed of his weapons, turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed about his horse, thinking to have recovered them again, but <hi>Valentine</hi> being on the ground, and seeing sit oportunity, cut off his horse feet, so that both he and his horse came tumbling to the Earth. Being on the earth, he suddenly arose again, and then they were both together by strength of arms holding one another. But to be short, the bickering was so fierce between them, that they were both sore wounded.</p>
               <p>The Pagan quickly healed his wounds with the Balm before spoken of. This Fight continued so long, that the day began to shut in, and both grew extream weary. The Gréen Knight was sore vexed that he could not overcome <hi>Valentine,</hi> and though he were even spent in weariness, yet he proudly bear it out, saying: Knight give over, for I perceive thy weariness, and the Sun declineth, therefore it would be little honour for me to conquer thee. Go, return again to <hi>Aquitain,</hi> and rest there this night, and report that there never encountred me so valiant a Knight as thou art.</p>
               <p>But méet me to morrow, and before thy coming, take leave of all thy friends, for thou shalt never return. <hi>Valentine</hi> accepted his kind offer, and was glad thereof, for he was weary and fore wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: So going to his horse, which was in another Field, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned back again to the City.

Being come into the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace, the Duke demanded what tydings from the Green Knight. Sir (said <hi>Valentine</hi>) he resteth in his Pavillion, and I think he
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:150341:52"/> is of that puissant strength and courage, that there is not a man living able to vanquish him. <hi>Valentine</hi> (quoth the Duke) you have escaped well, for never did any return as yet, but all have perished under the hand of the Gréen Knight, wherefore you have proved your self a valiant Knight. Gracious Duke (said <hi>Valen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine</hi>) of my conquest over him I can make but small boast, but to morrow there is appointed a new tryal of man-hood, and the victory may light upon whom the Gods please to favour. Having thus ended conference with the Duke, <hi>Valentine</hi> was unarmed, and then conducted to the Chamber of the Lady <hi>Fezon.</hi> The Lady was right joyful to see him return with life from the Combat of the Green Knight. By this time supper drew on, and the Duke taking his place at the Table, caused <hi>Valentine</hi> to be set on his left hand, at the uper end of the board, for the Duke did honour him in the highest degree that might be. Supper being ended, <hi>Valentine</hi> withdrew himself unto his private Chamber, and the Green Knight rested in his Pavillion, where we will leave him, and speak of <hi>Valentine,</hi> who being in his Chamber, made many complaints.</p>

After this the Green Knight (by consent) was Crowned King of the Green Mountain, and there held great state: presently upon this league of friendship concluded, he gave commandment throughout all his Host, that every man should depart away from the Confines of <hi>Aquitain,</hi> and return into their Countries without doing any further damage to Duke <hi>Savaries</hi> Country.

The Duke having thus said, the Lady answered for her self in this manner: My redoubted Lord and Father, you know I am your Daughter, therefore there is no reason why I should resist, but do submit my self to your dispose, for if I should do otherwise, it were in me great disobedience. And again, my Lord, you know promise is already past, that whosoever he was that could vanquish the Pagan Knight, should for his labour receive me for his Wife. Now my Lord, the day of my deliverance is come, so then (accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to your promise) you must give him to me, and I receive him as my lawful Spouse; otherwise I shall make void the edict before gone throughout the world, and you thought false in your promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses.

               <p>But to return back again to <hi>Blandiman,</hi> who hearing the King speak so much of the two children, demanded of the King if he k<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ew in what Country they were: Why (said the King) one of these I have brought up in my Court a long time, in such fashion, that he is become a right valiant Knight, and by his valour hath conquered his Brother, being a Wild-man, living in the Wood a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>nce</hi> like a Beast, and one that did much damage to all the Country thereabout. Having conquered him, he brought him to my Court, where having lived some small time, they both depart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and took their way towards <hi>Aquitain,</hi> to fight with a right worthy Champion, called the Green Knight, and since their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture I never heard what became of them. Sir (said <hi>Blandiman</hi>) according to the tale you have told, I remember well, that near <hi>Aquitain</hi> I met two such, but I am troubled that I knew them not. So the King musing at these accidents, caused <hi>Blandiman</hi> to be highly feasted, and held as a companion amongst his other Lords.</p>
               <p>Now it hapned, that on the same day the Green Knight (of whom we have before made mention) arrived at <hi>Paris</hi> at the Kings Court: assoon as he came into the presence of King, he saluted him with great reverence. The King seeing him all in Armour, marvelled much thereat, and at last demanded the cause of his so appearing, whom he was, and wherefore he came: The Gréen Knight replyed again on this manner. Honourable King, know that I am descended from the <hi>Sarazens,</hi> both by Father and Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; and true it is, that I am that Knight that for the love of the Lady <hi>Fezon,</hi> daughter to the Duke of <hi>Aquitain,</hi> have for one whole year holden the Duke as my Vassal, and in my subjection, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving him thus under me, I took a Truce with him for six months,
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:150341:58"/> upon these conditions, that if within that time he found not forth a Knight, that by force of A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ms should conquer me, I was to have his Daughter <hi>Fezon</hi> to Wife: On the other side; if I were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered, I should remove away my siege, and depart out of his Territories, without doing any further damage. So it is, that a long time I was fought withal, by divers valiant Knights of all Countries, yet there was not any that could overcome me, but endured death, and were still hanged upon a Tree; at last it so tell out, that there assailed me two worthy Knights, the one named <hi>Valentine,</hi> and the other <hi>Orson. Valentine</hi> fought with me one whole day, wherein he bore himself so bravely, that night coming on, we were forced to give over, all wounded, tired, and wear. The next morning when the battel should be again renewed, his fellow <hi>Orson</hi> armed himself in <hi>Valentines</hi> Armour, entred the field in most fierce and disdainful manner, offering me defiance: I <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>corning any competitor, addressed out my self against him, but little avail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed my strength, for in the end he overcame me, and would have ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken away my life, had not <hi>Valentine</hi> come in upon us, &amp; rescued me, upon condition, first, that I would forsake <hi>Mahomet:</hi> secondly, that I should come unto you, and yield my self at your command, and to stand to your censure either in life or death. Again, when I recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved Baptism, he caused me to be called <hi>Pepin,</hi> and so is my name.</p>
               <p>The King having heard all this long story from the G<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>éen Kt. made this answer in the presence of all his Barons: Welcome to us, and of your company we are right glad, live with us in our Court and be jocond, for I freely grant you your life, and promise you further, that if you will tarry with us in our Country, I will endow you with many fair lands and possessions. The King shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing himself thus gracious, demanded of him where these Knights were, that had conquered him: Marry (qd. the Green Kt.) I left them both at <hi>Aquitain</hi> with the valiant Duke <hi>Savary,</hi> who holdeth them in as great respect as any that are remaining in his Court.</p>
               <p>Thus you may now perceive, that by the words of <hi>Blan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diman,</hi> and the Green Knight, King <hi>Pepin</hi> had perfect intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence of his beautious Sister, and his two valiant Nephews.

Vpon a day, as he sat at dinner with the Pope in his Palace pontifical, there came tydings unto him; that the great Souldan of <hi>Aegypt</hi> had besieged <hi>Constan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinople.</hi> The Knight that brought this message, after his salutati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons ended, began thus to proceed: Holy Father, the <hi>Sa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>azens</hi> with much power hath besieged, and wronfully over-run <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantinople,</hi> and he gave me charge to crave your aid against these enemies of Christendom. When the Pope understood these ill-welcome tydings, he was driven into a wondrous dump, not knowing any present way to send them relief: but King <hi>Pepin</hi> being in presence, comforted him greatly, and said: Holy Father, take no care for this business, for I request but a competent sum of money and men, and I shall lead them to <hi>Constantinople</hi> with such a couragious heart, that I shall put the Soldan and his forces to the worse, such an inveterate hatred beat I against these Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan Devils. The Pope hearing him so resolute, thanked him for his couragious heart, and said unto him: Right Christian King, seeing thou dost proffer thy self in person to undertake this service, I shall with all convenient speed provide for a business of such import. Presently hereupon by a day all things prepared, and with an Army of thirty thousand <hi>Romans</hi> K. <hi>Pepin</hi> departed, and

               <p>The Emperor himself was forced to retire into the City, and being cooped up in so small a room, his troubled thoughts ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more ran upon the Lady <hi>Bellysant,</hi> whom he had cruelly banished, always fearful that she was dead, for it was now full twenty W<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

The Soldan having knowledge of his arrival, and also of his provision, was much abashed thereat, and wjth all diligence returned to his strong Pavilion; and being set down in his magnificence, there came unto him certain of his camp fearfully and doubtfully saying thus unto him: Great and mighty Soldan, we come to give you true intelligence, that there is lately, arrived to the number of two hundred thousand <hi>Romans,</hi> to bid us present battel, under the conduct of <hi>Pepin</hi> King of <hi>France.</hi> Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it only resteth now, that you take sudden advise how to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent and resist these forces. Peace scréech-owls (quoth the Soldan) be not afraid, for you are deluded by some false report, the whole <hi>Roman</hi> Nation is not able to furnish forth such an Army. Go on I say couragiously, for I swear by <hi>Mahomet,</hi> e're long I shall bring under my subjection, both the Kingdom of <hi>Rome</hi> and <hi>France</hi> also: Wherefore call up your Troops, plant them, and put our Squadron in readiness to receive them.</p>
               <p>The morrow following K. <hi>Pepin</hi> let his Army in order of bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel fiercely to assault the Pagan Host, and secretly sent a Letter to the Emperor, being in the City, whereby he requested the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror, that they within y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> City should put themselves in readiness, and so issue out upon the Pagans on that side, for King <hi>Pepin</hi> and his companies would receive them on the other side, then being all encompassed about, there was hope to get the day of the <hi>Sarazens.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Emperor received these Letters joyfully, and did as King <hi>Pepin</hi> commanded them, and issued forth of the City, bidding bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel to the <hi>Sarazein.</hi> They were no sooner entred the field, but they

This made the Pagans to look about, and the Soldan calling to him two of his hardiest men of war, commanded them secretly to go through the Host of the Christians, and if it were possible, to number them. These two did as the Souldan com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded, but being come near the Host of King <hi>Pepin,</hi> the Green Knight esp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

               <head>CHAP. XXVII. How the Green Knight Justed against the two Sarazens, and having slain the one the other fled: and how King Pepin and his Host was lodged within Constantinople.</head>
               <p>THe Green Knight having recovered a new Spear, he ran fiercely against both the Sarazens, and hiting one of them in a very dangerous place, smote him to the earth, so that he ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver rose, then making against the other, he gave him such a wound that he suddenly fled away: King <hi>Pepin</hi> seeing this accident, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently assailed the Soldans Host, and <hi>Myllon Daugler</hi> flew the King of <hi>Aquile,</hi> and three other e're he gave over the field, with many and divers other worthy deeds of Chivalry: The Souldan seeing him so play the Devil in his Host, cryed out to follow <hi>Daugler</hi> that had made such havock: So they did as he command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, pursuing him so close on both sides, that at length they cut off one of his horses thighs, forcing him to fall upon the earth, and had there perished, had not the Green Knight (manger all the Sarazens) thrust himself into the press, slaying and beating down as many as made any resistance, and in the end so relieved <hi>Daug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler,</hi> that he freshly horsed him, and brought him clean out of dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger.
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:150341:60"/> After this, they both joyned together in such furious out-rage, that they spared none that came in their way. Fierce was this battel and endured long, but King <hi>Pepin</hi> and his men made great slaughter among the Pagans: but notwithstanding all this their valour they had lost the day, had it not been for the Emperor, that with his Host valiantly assaild the Pagans on the other side, and made amongst them a very bloody slaughter. The King seeing the courage of the Emperour so great, gathered together again his scattered Troops, and entred into the battel with great fury, and now were the Pagans begirt round about. Assoon as the King came unto the sight of the Emperour, he said unto him: Great Prince, shew thy self right valiant, and this day e're night, I shall tell thee tydings of thy fair Lady <hi>Bellysant.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>These words added fresh courage unto the Emperor, who cryed out to his men: Courage for <hi>Constantinople,</hi> and he that wins honor shall be richly rewarded. And with these words entred into the thickest of the battel; where he, King <hi>Pepin,</hi> and the Green Kt. so valiantly behaved themselves, that which way soever they turned, they made way before them.</p>
               <p>Now began the Sarazens to doubt whether they should ever escape away alive, and therefore fearing the worst, betook them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves to flight: But their flight being espyed by the King of <hi>Scla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vonia,</hi> who led the rear-ward for the Souldan, presently rushed in with his troops, consisting of fifty thousand fighting men, make<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing withal so great a shout, that it seemed by the sound thereof, their part got the better. The Emperor and the King perceiving their coming, wisely considered that their men were tyred and out-worn, and the enemy fresh and lusty, sounded a retreat, and retired themselves and all their Souldiers into the City. The Souldan seeing this, followed upon them, and strongly besieged the City round about, so that neither the Emperor nor the King could issue out thereof. Thus they abode till they were well nigh famished thinking thereby utterly to overthrough the Christians. So leave we them, and return to <hi>Valentine</hi> and <hi>Orson,</hi> who for the love of <hi>Clerimond,</hi> have adventured, as you have already heard.</p>

               <p>AFter many days travel, at last <hi>Valentine</hi> and <hi>Orson</hi> lighted upon an Island, in which Island stood a Castle, strong and impregnable, the covering whereof was of shining mettal, glit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering in the Sun, that it drave <hi>Valentine</hi> into suspection that it was it, whereunto the Green Knight had directed him to have a sight of the fair Lady <hi>Clerimond.</hi> At all Adventures he maketh way towards this Castle, and at last entred into this Island by one of the Ports thereof. Being entred, he demanded who was owner of that Castle which appeared so sumptuous to the eye? Answer was returned, that the Castle was in the keeping of the fair <hi>Clerimond,</hi> Sister unto the Gyant <hi>Ferragus,</hi> and builded by a mighty man in substance a <hi>Sarazen</hi> the which <hi>Sarazen,</hi> amongst all other his excellent works done in this Castle, he caused one chamber to be richly adorned: of the which chamber more shall be spoken of in that place.</p>

Having gathered knowledge enough, he left questioning any further, and went on his way, accompanied with <hi>Orson,</hi> to see if he could get entrance into this castle. By this time they were come to the gates thereof
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:150341:61"/> where thinking to enter, they were resisted by ten sturdy Knights, that kept the gate night and day.</p>

               <p>When they saw <hi>Valentine</hi> and <hi>Orson</hi> make proffer to enter, they said unto them: Lorde, or what ever you be, withdraw your selves back, for into this Castle entreth none, of what birth soe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, without the leave and lisence of a Maiden, to whom we (as Guard) do appertain. Why (quoth <hi>Valentine</hi>) go tell her, and ask whether it be her pleasure we enter or not? Hereupon one of them entred the Chamber where fair <hi>Clerimond</hi> was, and kneeling un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to her said: Lady, before your Gate standeth two Gallants, that would enter your Castle, they seem fierce and couragious, full of high spirit, and men far disagreeing from the Laws and Religion of our Country: Now fair Lady say, shall they have entrance? De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scend (quoth the Lady) while I go forth into a window to take a view of them, and let the gates be surely kept, for I mean to que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion with them my self.

Lady (qd. <hi>Valentine,</hi> with an undaunted courage) I am a Knight that travelleth this way, and would gladly speak with that head of brass that remaineth within this Castle, if it be your pleasure, because (as I do understand) it resolveth doubts.

This choice chose <hi>Valentine,</hi> rather then to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wray the King which he had brought along with him, given him by the Green Knight, to present to his Sister <hi>Clerimond.</hi> The Lady seeing his resolute hardness, suddenly fell in love with him, and presently went into the Chamber where the Head of Brass stood, and said unto it; what is that Knight of courage that would so gladly enter this Castle?

Being armed, he mounted his horse, couched his spear in his rest, and withal issued out of the gate in readiness. The Lady also, got into a window to behold the Combat. When <hi>Valentine</hi> saw the Seneschal to come towards him, he couched his spear, and putting spurs to his horse they met so fiercely, that their spears brake in pieces, presently having a new supply, suddenly they met so fiercely that they fell to the ground horse &amp; man: but <hi>Valentines</hi> horse got up with his ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster. <hi>Valentine</hi> being thus saved by his horse, said unto the Senes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chal; Rise up, and newly mount your self, for there is no honor in
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:150341:63"/> conquering an enemy at advantage. Whereupon the Seneschal was freshly mounted, and new spears given them again: then took they a fresh carier, and herewithal <hi>Valentine</hi> so encountred him about the head, that he bore away his helm, and threw both horse and man down upon the earth. The Seneschal féeling himself in danger said thus unto <hi>Valentine;</hi> Knight, I know not from whence you are, nor of what parentage, but never in my life found I a man of thy valor, wherefore I yield, and withal give thee leave to enter this Castle at thy pleasure (only upon this condition, that you speak not unto the Lady <hi>Clerimond</hi> without my leave.) Quoth <hi>Valentine,</hi> thou hast requested that which I will not grant, for know, it was for her love that I came hither, and though I never yet saw her, yet are my thoughts on fire. Therefore from hence I will never part till I have spoken with her, and also with the Brazen-Head. The Lady all this while standing at the win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow, wondred what conference passed betwéen these two Champi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and at last thus said unto one of her Maidens: See how in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>discréet this Seneschal is, to fight with such a valiant Knight, who long since might have taken away his life. When <hi>Valentine</hi> saw the great pride of the Seneschal, and that he stood it out with him, being his Prisoner, he presently run against him another course, and therewithal gave him so deadly a stroak, that he ran him clean through the body, so that he fell off his Horse stark dead; at the which the Lady <hi>Clerimond</hi> was exceeding joyful, commanding them to set open the Gates, and that <hi>Valentine</hi> should be brought up unto her in the great Hall. When that the Lady beheld <hi>Valen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine</hi> well, she came towards him, and said unto him on this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner: Knight, you are most welcome, for I never saw a more vali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant and couragious man all the days of my life: Enter my Castle, for it appeareth by your Valour and Chivalry, that you are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scended from the loyns of some Royal Stock.

                  <hi>VAlentine</hi> having purchased free entrance by overcoming the Seneschal, at last he shewed the Ring that the Gréen Knight had given him, and smiling delivered it to the Lady, who gladly received the token, saying: Fair Knight, had you shewed this Ring when you first craved access into this Castle, you had never endured the danger that you have now escaped; but sith it hath pleased you to try your valor, I cannot better commend you, then to admire your brave couragious heart. Whilst <hi>Valentine</hi> and the Lady were thus talking together, the tables were spread, the Lady sat down, and <hi>Valentine</hi> was also placed just against her, in whom she took her greatest felicity, as he in her dinner being ended, <hi>Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rimond</hi> arose from the Table, &amp; taking <hi>Valentine</hi> by the hand, said thus unto him: Sir, well have you purchased your welcome, deser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving to enter into my priviest chamber, and so you shall, even that chamber wherein the Braxen Head standeth, the which Head shall declare all that you can desire, and make no doubt but it will tell you most joyful tydings; wherefore both you and your Companion come along with me, for I gladly long to hear, as you desire to be heard.

               <p>NOw shall you understand, that within this Castle where <hi>Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rimond</hi> was, dwelt a Dwarf (named <hi>Pacolet</hi>) which the Lady had nourished, and brought up of a Child, bestowoing much cost to have him taught in Schools: This <hi>Pacolet</hi> being of more age then stature, grew exceeding witty, and at last he studied the black-Art and therein grew so famous in Negromancy, that by enchant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment he had composed a little Horse made of wood; in the head of which horse, he had so artificially conveyed a pin of wood, that every time he mounted on his back to ride abroad, he would turn the pin toward the place he would go unto, and suddenly he would be in the same place without danger, for the Horse could run through the Air more swift then any bird. This <hi>Pacolet</hi> being in the Castle, observed the behaviour of <hi>Valentine,</hi> and when he had fit time, he addressed himself for <hi>Portugal,</hi> to bear news to <hi>Ferra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gus,</hi> how all matters had passed at the Castle. So he betook him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self to his wooden horse, and in a moment of time (setting the pin for that part) he arrived there, according to his desired wish, and related the story unto <hi>Ferragus.</hi> When <hi>Ferragus</hi> heard this tale, he grew excéeding angry against <hi>Valentine,</hi> for that he should have his Sister in marriage: also, he grew enraged at her, that she would grant her love unto him (being a Christian Knight) swearing by his Gods to take revenge upon them both: but all this while he dissembled unto <hi>Pacolet,</hi> bidding him return and bear this mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage to <hi>Clerimond,</hi> that the Kt. <hi>Valentine,</hi> who shall have her to wife, is right welcome, and that e're long I will come in person to visit them, accompanied with a gallant troop of Nobles, and then shall
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:150341:65"/> their Nuptial be royally solemnized; so <hi>Pacolet</hi> took leave and got him on his horse, and was in an instant come home again.

At this tale the Lady stood amazed, and at last began to answer him thus; Ah <hi>Pacolet,</hi> is this true that thou hast told? Aye me, the Gods defend my brother from plotting any treason against me, for I am well assured he could never abide a Knight of <hi>France,</hi> nor any other that is a Christian; I am right angry that thou didst not acquaint me with thy departure, for I had a serious business for thee to do, which was to have enquired there for a Christian-woman, one that of long time hath had her abiding with my Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Ferragus,</hi> in the Castle that he now holdeth.</p>

               <head>CHAP. XXXIII. How Valentine and Orson were betrayed by the treachery of Ferragus; and how he committed them to prison, with their woful lamentations.</head>
               <p>
                  <hi>FErragus</hi> having thus gotten their good wills to depart for <hi>Portugal,</hi> put all his ships in a readiness, and packing up all their provision, they put forth to Sea. Being now at Sea, <hi>Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragus</hi> fell from all his former words of comfort, and began to plot the death of <hi>Valentine</hi> and <hi>Orson.</hi> In the dead time of the night, when the two Brethren were at rest in their Cabins, he caused them secretly to be taken forth of their beds, and committed them to bands, muzling their eyes also, that they could not see: Now, when <hi>Clerimond</hi> saw what was done to her love, she fell into an extream agony, and with watry eyes began thus to vent her la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentations: Alas dear <hi>Valentine</hi> our joys are suddenly turned unto sorrow; thou hast bought my love at too dear a rate, when thou art not only thus misused, but even in danger of thy life: Cursed be the day of my birth, for with much danger hast thou purchased my love. Alas, alas, what shall I do? Rent Heart, weep forth my eyes, when such a valiant, hardy, and most magna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimous Knight must be thus tortured for my sake? Thou hast deceived the trust I put in thee, by working so foul an act against my love: Thou hast robbed me of all joy and brought upon me an untimely death. Further, know this, that if you put to death these two Knights, you carry to your grave the name of a villain. Let them alone, their death will work you small content: or if there be no remedy, spare them and seize first upon me, and cast me into the Sea, for I would not live to see such two innocents falsly put to death without desert. Yea, even so much was the Lady perplexed, that with very hearts sorrow she would have slain her self, or else violently have leaped over-board into the Sea.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ferragus</hi> perceiving her in this desperate fit, gave strict com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:150341:67"/> that she should be well attended by some of his Barons, and especially that she should not so much as speak a word with either of the Prisoners; and leaving her to her laments, the Christians both, <hi>Valentine</hi> and <hi>Orson</hi> fast bound in bands. <hi>Valentine</hi> perceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing himself thus betrayed, began thus to bemoan his hard hap: Alas, quoth he, how contrarily hath fortune dealt with me? I have spent all my youth in travel and danger, only to find out the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents that begot me? and see now when hope had well nigh set an end to all my sorrows, I am unhapily fallen into the hands of mine enemies that only seek my death. Alas Brother <hi>Orson,</hi> how suddenly are all our joys blasted, &amp; our mirth turned into mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing? On this wise complained <hi>Valentine</hi> and <hi>Orson,</hi> but all this while are they on their way towards <hi>Portugal,</hi> and shortly after arrived at the Castle of <hi>Ferragus.</hi> Being there arrived, tydings was brought to the Lady <hi>Bellysant,</hi> that two Christian Knights were come along with them as Prisoners: at which news she quickly left her chamber, and came to have a sight of them. When she was come near unto them, and had well reviewed them, at last she said thus unto them: Children (quoth she) of what Country be you, and where were you born? Lady (quoth <hi>Valentine</hi>) we be of <hi>France,</hi> and born not far from <hi>Paris. Ferragus</hi> perceiving the Lady to speak unto them, sharply rebuked her, saying: Lady, leave your questioning, for except they renounce their faith, they shall miserably end their days in Prison: And herewithal called unto him a Iaylor, and committed them into a Dungeon, to be there kept only with bread and water. This misery was not sufficient; but more then that, certain churlish Sarazens standing by, smote these two Children with their fists and staves.</p>
               <p>After <hi>Ferragus</hi> had commited them, he gat him up into his Palace, and called forth his Sister <hi>Clerimond</hi> unto him; when she came before him, she could not forbear tears, which made him thus to say unto her: Sister, leave weeping, for I swear by <hi>Maho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>met,</hi> you have too long doted upon the Brazen-Head, as well ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth, in that you make your choice with one of a contrary Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion: but change your mind, for it is a shame that you should first take him to husband, that hath béen the overthrow of our brother the Green Knight: next a Christian, whom our Laws do abhor.

Brother (qd. <hi>Cleri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond</hi>) it behoveth me to obey you, for I plainly see I must let go the thing I cannot have; for whereas force constraineth fear hath little power, and necessity often preventeth truth. These discour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses finished, <hi>Ferragus</hi> departed with his Queen and other atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dants, and entring the great hall, with very much honor and reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence they received the Lady <hi>Clerimond,</hi> the Queen thus saying unto her; Sister, welcome, for I have long desired to have a sight of you. Lady (qd. <hi>Clerimond</hi>) I give you millions of thanks, but know this, that I am right heavy and sad for two Christian Kts. that are come hither, under colour of friendship and love, brought over by my Brothers fair promises, and now to be violently hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, as to be thrown into a dungeon, and also threatned to death. This Sister, even this, wounds my soul, and splitteth my very heart in sunder. Alas Sister, pitty me, for one of these Knights should be my husband, amongst all men living; he is the comliest, valiantest, and hardiest Knight that lives upon the face of the earth. Again (dear Sister) by force of arms hath he conquered his Foe, and won my love, wherefore Lady, pitty my distressed estate, and let me see that Christian Lady, which you have so long kept within this Castle. Sister (said the Queen) I shall gladly consent to your desire herein: and so bringing them together, the Lady <hi>Bellysant</hi> said thus unto her: Lady, what is your will with me? speak on, for I would gladly hear any thing you have to say. Then thus, I bring you joyful tydings, and yet the end of my tale will be as sorrowful, as the beginning is joyful: Know this, that I am not ignorant of your estate and dignity; for you are Sister to <hi>Pepin</hi> King of <hi>France,</hi> and wife unto the Emperor of <hi>Greece,</hi> who wrongfully banished you his Country: soon after your exile you were in your travel delivered of two fair Sons in a Forrest, one of which was taken from you by a Bare, and the other you lost you know not how. All this is true. Nay Lady, your Children are both alive, and I can tell you where to find them. At these words <hi>Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lysant</hi> fell into a swound for joy; <hi>Clerimond</hi> quickly recovered
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:150341:68"/> her again, and then the Lady said unto her: Fair Damosel, how came all these things to your understanding? Then <hi>Clerimond</hi> related the whole story, how <hi>Ferragus</hi> her Brother by subtilty and Treason had put them into a dungeon. <hi>Bellysant</hi> hearing her two Children were imprisoned by <hi>Ferragus,</hi> made great lamentation, insomuch that the Wife of <hi>Ferragus</hi> entred the Hall, to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand the cause of these mournful clamours; <hi>Clerimond</hi> told the Quéen all, from point to point: Well (said the Quéen) be apeased, and dissemble the cause from the King, for if he have any know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge thereof, it will make him rather so much the worse, than better affected, either to them, or you.</p>

               <p>IT chanced upon a day that <hi>Ferragus</hi> made a great Feast for all his Nobles, which day they passed in such revelling and mirth, that the night growing late, they all betook themselves to rest. Being all at rest, <hi>Pacolet</hi> was still watchful to give the Ladies content, and coming to a great Tower, whose gates were brass, and surely locked, by his enchantment the gates flew open, and he entred surely thereinto: Anon he came unto the door of the prison, where the Ladies two sons lay bound, and as soon as he touched the door, the locks brake, and flew open as before. The two Princes lying there in a dark dungeon, and hearing the door open, were greatly perplexed, for they looked for nothing but present death; and at last <hi>Valentine</hi> began to wéep, but <hi>Orson</hi> said unto him; Take courage Brother, for it behoveth us to prepare for death; and sith it is so, he that first entreth here, to lay hand upon me, shall dearly pay for his adventure: with that he laid hold of a great Iron Bar, that lay thereby; but at last <hi>Pacolet</hi> spake unto them, saying: Lords, fear me not, for I am come to set you free from forth this dungeon, wherefore make no noise, but follow me, and before the morrow Sun, I shall bring you both unto your Mother: <hi>Valentine</hi> at this speech rejoyced greatly, but <hi>Orson</hi> beholding him with an austéer look, would not give any credit to his words. <hi>Pacolet</hi> at the fierce look of <hi>Orson,</hi> was much afraid, insomuch that he gave back, but by the words of <hi>Valentin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

Having thus done, he returned again unto the Castle without any suspition: being come, at last he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan thus unto his Mother <hi>Bellisant,</hi> and the Lady <hi>Clerimond,</hi> say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; that he would suddenly depart for <hi>Greece,</hi> towards <hi>Constan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinople,</hi> to see his Father the Emperor, who without any just cause had banished his Mother.

               <p>He was a mighty man, who was in stature about thirteen foot in height. Being out of the Town, he calling his men about him, went forward to follow them that were escaped letting none pass he met withal, but he demanded tydings of them, yet he could not hear of them, for <hi>Pacolet</hi> by his Art was too subtile for <hi>Ferragus.</hi> At last, being tyred with pursuit, he swore that he would besiege the castle of <hi>Clerimond,</hi> for he did think assuredly to find her there, but all in vain, for they had been there, but they were departed before his coming. Thus enraged, he swore by <hi>Mahomet,</hi> that he would either find <hi>Clerimond</hi> and all her company, or else he would shake all Christendom, and so departed the Castle.</p>

               <p>THe Duke of <hi>Aquitain</hi> calling to mind the huge Army of the Sarazens that lay before the City, valiantly resolved to give them present battel the next morrow; so calling up all his forces, &amp; placing them in readiness there hapned a bloody battel before the City of <hi>Aquitain,</hi> and many a brave Leader on both parts, there lost their lives.

This happening, the Christians were forced to fall back, whereby the Duke himself was begirt with enemies so that none might come to succour him, yet in the midst of all these dangers, he bare himself most valiant, and still cryed, <hi>Aquitain, Aquitain,</hi> my Noble hearts fight on for <hi>Aquitain:</hi> but in the end all little availed, <hi>Ferragus</hi> having once gotten a sight of him, came near, and at last took him Prisoner, and led him to his Pavilion. <hi>Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragus</hi> having thus bestowed the Duke, came up again to the bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel, which struck such an amazement into the hearts of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians, that they would have forsaken the field, especially, because they had lost the Duke, their Lord and Master. <hi>Valentine</hi> &amp; <hi>Orson</hi> séeing them thus to waver, came up with all the spéed they could, and cryed out unto them with a loud voice: Valiant Kts. and men of <hi>Aquitain,</hi> shew your selves men, run not away in time of extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity, for if you do, lamentable will be your reproach: be hardy and couragious once again, and let us try the fortune of the day.</p>
               <p>These two Knights having thus done speaking, the people began afresh to gather up their scattered forces, &amp; turned their forces once more upon the Sarazens, with a double courage. By this time ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings was brought into the City, that the Duke was taken Priso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, at which ill news the Lady <hi>Fezon</hi> lamented more then all the rest, saying with a heavy heart, shedding tears, Alas my father, now is your life in hazard, for from these Sarazens there is no hope of any mercy. Farewel sweet Father (quoth she) I shall never hereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter see you again, but shall be here left as a dejected Orphan.

                  <hi>Valentine</hi> all this while is amongst the thickest, hewing forth his way with his sword. <hi>Orson</hi> on the other side, was not idle, for he had taken an oath, that either he would frée y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> Duke from cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivity, or leave his body amongst the rest. <hi>Pacolet</hi> the Magician, and Dwarf, promised <hi>Orson</hi> aid and assistance at néed, and thus all busied, and nigh hand wearied, <hi>Orson</hi> put spurs to his horse, and ran violently through the battel, &amp; escaped. <hi>Orson</hi> and <hi>Pacolet</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

Having thus said, they all thrée took their way back again thorow the Camp of the enemy, without disturb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance. All this while was <hi>Valentine</hi> in the Army, demanding what was become of his brother <hi>Orson,</hi> but when he found no man that could tell him tydings of him, he grew wondrous heavy and sad, fearing lest he had béen slain in the conflict of the battel.</p>
               <p>Thus passed <hi>Valentine</hi> from place to place, to find out his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Orson,</hi> and with a resolute mind rushed afresh into the battel, and as a man distracted, he laid so forcibly about him, that not a Pagan was able to stand against him. <hi>Ferragus</hi> espying him so valiant, came up to close him, and having gotten him once in chase, never left him, until he had slain his horse under him.</p>

Knight (quoth the Lady) you ought to forbear, for all your labour is lost: It is true, I love all Knights; yea, and all good men too, in the rule of honor, but as for him whom I mean to make my husband, him will I nevrr change nor yet forget. Why? but fair Lady (quoth <hi>Orson</hi>) that which your Royal Father hath provided for you, ought to please you: Sir (said she) it is reason that I obey my Father, but if so be my Father will constrain me to break my Faith, and forsake him that van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quished the Green Knight, I will rather leave my Father, than once offer to break by Faith. Lady (quoth <hi>Orson</hi>) I wonder how you can set your affections on such a man, for he is of a wild na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and disposition, besides (as your Father reporteth) is dumb and cannot speak a word: True (quoth the Lady) yet love learneth me to love him with a faithful affection, to whom my Faith is alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy fixed: and therefore stay your suit, for I will never alter nor change my mind from him.</p>

Sir (said <hi>Pacolet</hi>) mount you upon my wooden Horse, and try the event that will follow after. <hi>Valentine</hi> answered, that will I do, for I desire nothing so much as the sight of my Father, whom I never saw. <hi>Valentine</hi> on the morrow prepared for to depart: But before his departure, the Duke married his Daughter unto <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,</hi> in the presence of the Lady <hi>Bellysant,</hi> and the Lady <hi>Cleri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond,</hi> with the consent of his Nobles that were at the Wedding, where there was great triumphs, and in this assembly there was a spy, who observed all the procéeding, and gave intelligence thereof unto <hi>Ferragus.</hi> When <hi>Ferragus</hi> had received these tydings, he vowed by <hi>Mahomet</hi> to be revenged on them all, but especially on <hi>Pacolet,</hi> for stealing away his sister <hi>Clerimond,</hi> whom he so much loved, and had ranked her among the Christians.</p>

So now he takes his last farewel of his dear Mother, with this charge, that so soon as they were arrived, he should send <hi>Pacolet</hi> to bring tydings of all that had hapned.</p>

Valen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine</hi> was wondrous joyful, that he was so near the place he so much desired to see, and by the help of <hi>Pacolet</hi> the Enchanter, came that night even to the great Hall, where the Emperor ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied with King <hi>Pepin,</hi> sat both at supper. <hi>Valentine</hi> being come into such an unknown presence, grew very bashful, but the Green Knight sitting at the Table, with the Emperor and King <hi>Pepin,</hi> espyed <hi>Valentine,</hi> and knew him, so did King <hi>Pepin</hi> take knowledge of him likewise, saying thus unto the Emperor: Great Emperor, behold here one of your own blood, a valiant Knight, and your own natural Son. The Emperor hearing this, was much a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mazed, and rising from the Table made towards him, and kissed him; the Green Knight was the first that took him in his arms, and embraced him, then King <hi>Pepin</hi> next, and lastly the Emperor his Father, who was greatly ashamed at his foul fact, in banishing his unspotted and guiltless Wife.</p>
               <p>It chanced so likewise, that in this presence was her old servant <hi>Blandiman,</hi> who well observed <hi>Pacolet,</hi> ever since he saw him in <hi>Portugal,</hi> and at last he went unto him, demanding how it fared with his old Lady and Mistris, the Lady <hi>Bellysant: Pacolet</hi> satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied him in all his demands, so that exceeding great joy and glad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness was heard about the City for the love of <hi>Valentine,</hi> and peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple came from all parts to behold the Emperors Son, the valiant Knight. <hi>Valentine</hi> seeing such continual recourse of all estates ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thering

The Soldan perceiving <hi>Pacolets</hi> horse to make a stay, said thus unto him: Friend, are we at our journeys end? Yea, and fear nothing, for we are now in <hi>Portugal,</hi> in the Palace of King <hi>Ferragus.</hi> By <hi>Maho<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Now sitteth the Soldan in the Hall, attending the coming back of <hi>Pacolet,</hi> while he in the mean space, maketh towards the chamber wherein the Emperor lay; being come to the door, he gave a great blow against it, insomuch, as the Chamberlain asked who it was that thus presumed to disturb the Emperors rest: Friend (qd. <hi>Pacolet</hi>) fear not, for I am <hi>Pacolet,</hi> newl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

Besides, say unto the Emperor, that I have brought along with me the Soldan himself, to be in <hi>Portugal:</hi> Wherefore he may now be revenged on him at full, for he hath most justly deserved death. The Chamberlain told the Emperor all these tydings and King <hi>Pepin</hi> also, so arm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing themselves, they came into the Hall where the Soldan sat: the Soldan perceiving himself betrayed, cryed out with a loud voice: Thou false <hi>Pacolet,</hi> Traitor to my person, I vow to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venged upon thée, for thy disloyal practice towards me, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withal
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:150341:79"/> drew forth his Sword, and like a mad man ran up and down the Hall, striking the very stones to fiercely, that he made the fire to flye from those senceless wall. As he was in this mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing fit, the Attendants entred towards him with Torches. The Souldan espying them, defended himself so fiercely, that he slew the Squire that attended upon King <hi>Pepin:</hi> This act of his, fired the courage of the King, that he made a blow at him, and felled him to the earth. Being fallen, they bound him hand and foot, and in the morning, came <hi>Valentine</hi> and the Green Knight, who find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Soldan there in bands, was very joyful.</p>
               <p>The Emperor and the King séeing <hi>Valentine,</hi> were joyful for his deliverance, giving great thanks to <hi>Pacolet</hi> for his care over his Son, and withal said: <hi>Pacolet,</hi> one strain more of thy horse must I demand; you shall Sir (quoth <hi>Pacolet</hi>) and if you will get behind me, I shall instantly transport you into hell. But Lords, let that pass, and return unto the death of the Soldan, for if he escape your hands at this time, a world of miseries will follow: so that very hour they proceeded to Iudgement, and cammanded him to be hanged on the greatest Tower of the Palace, even in the very sight of all his P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

               <p>This done, the Pagans stood as men confounded and amazed to sée him there hanging, &amp; wondred how he came within the City; but at last, <hi>Bryan</hi> his Vncle told them how he had been deceived by that Traitor <hi>Pacolet.</hi> After they had long lamented the death of the Soldan, they gathered themselves to counsed, and in his stead chose his Vncle <hi>Bryan</hi> Soldan. After all these things done, <hi>Pacolet</hi> took his leave of the Emperor, and returned into <hi>Aqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,</hi> to comfort the Lady <hi>Clerimond;</hi> as he promised: but before his departure, <hi>Valentine</hi> came unto him and said; <hi>Pacolet,</hi> at your coming into <hi>Aquitain,</hi> salute from me my Mother <hi>Bellysant,</hi> and my loving Lady <hi>Clerimond,</hi> my brother <hi>Orson,</hi> and the good Duke of <hi>Aquitain,</hi> with the rest of his Nobles, and above all the rest, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver this to my Mother, by which she shall understand our whole procéedings here. Sir, said <hi>Pacolet,</hi> all this shall I willingly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form; so taking his horse, he leapt upon him; and he flew up into the air as swift as smoak.</p>
               <p>The next morning <hi>Pacolet</hi> was come to his journeys end, and

Thanks gentle K. I am much bound to you for your love, and if he can but get <hi>Pacolet</hi> into my hands, I shall reward him liberally. Sir (qd. <hi>Adrimain</hi>) put your trust in me, and so I take my leave, and so betook him to his magick Art. Being provided of all things, amongst y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> rest, he laded himself with victu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als, and took his way towards <hi>Aquitain;</hi> coming thither, he craved entrance of the gates to sell his victuals, which was easily granted. After he had sold all, he went into the Palace where he chanced on <hi>P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

Then (said <hi>Adrimain</hi>) you know that long I served K. <hi>Trompart,</hi> put by fate I am fallen into a great mischance, for one in his Court hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing smitten me, because I would not teach him the principles of my Art, I drew forth my knife and killed him: Now fearing death, I am expelled the Court and for this cause I fled towards you for succour, &amp; will prove unto you a faithful servant, so you be pleased to accept of me. <hi>Adrimain,</hi> said <hi>Pacolet,</hi> I am content let it be so, make thee good chear, and be merry. As they were thus in their Cups, <hi>Adrimain</hi> saw the fair <hi>Clerimond</hi> pass through the Hall, who presently demanded what Lady it was: Then (said <hi>P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>colet</hi>) it is the S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

               <p>At whose words, <hi>Adrimain</hi> drew up a Cup above a Pillar, in such wise, that through the Palace (séemingly to all the company) ran a River, furnished with all sorts of fish, little and great. When the beholders saw the water to come so strongly against them, they were afraid of drowning, <hi>P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>colet</hi> beholding this feat, amongst the rest, began a song, and in that song a Charm, that it seemed to all the beholders, that a great Hart ran thorow that River, over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning all things that stood in his wa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>. After this Hart ran Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters with their Hounds. This made many of the beholders leap
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:150341:80"/> after, thinking to have taken the Hart: but <hi>Pacolet</hi> by his Art made the Hart suddenly to vanish. This sport (qd. <hi>Orson</hi>) was very well performed: and so the company breaking up, <hi>Pacolet</hi> led <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drima<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

Afterward he went towards the horse of <hi>P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>colet,</hi> &amp; getting him, came into the Chamber of <hi>Clerimond,</hi> and by Art caused her to rise, and make her ready, and setting her on the Horse behind him, came unto a window, turned a pin, and suddenly he arrived in the Tent of King <hi>Trompart.</hi> Being come thither, he cryed out aloud, saying: Great King, sleep not, but hasten you hither, and you shall see the pleasant Lady <hi>Clerimond,</hi> whom I have stollen from <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitain,</hi> and with her <hi>Pacolets</hi> horse. Now, said the King, I well perceive thy love: is this the Sister of <hi>Ferragus?</hi> Yea, said <hi>Adri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main,</hi> and I have stolen her away, and also betrayed <hi>Pacolet</hi> my fellow Magician, for he shall never be master of his horse again. I, but (said the King) art thou acquainted with the manner of his horse? O, long since, worthy King, and by vertue of the Pin, how to govern him. Having thus made this known unto K. <hi>Trompart,</hi> he thought to make experience of the horse himself, and taking the Lady <hi>Clerimond</hi> behind him, would transport her into his own Country, and there marry her.</p>
               <p>He being thus determined, he embraced the Lady in his arms, (for all this while she was not awaked out of her enchanted sleep) and set her on the horse of wood. All this <hi>Adrimain</hi> was eye-wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of, and said thus unto him: My Lord if you fail one jot of the true use of the horse, both your self and the Lady are in very great danger. Fear not that (quoth <hi>Trompart</hi>) and so turning the Pin, he mounted swiftly into the Air, and before the next morning he was 200 miles on his way, but not at his journeys end, for now a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waked the Lady <hi>Clerimond</hi> out of her own Enchanted sleep, who seeing her self so deluded, fell suddenly into a swound, this chance struck to the heart of King <hi>Trompart,</hi> for he was afraid lest she had been dead, and so turning the pin he stoped the Horse in a fair green field by a Fountain, then taking the Lady from the Horse, he laid her on the grass, and took a little water, and cast it on her
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:150341:81"/> face, and the Lady recovered, being recovered, she made such grievous lamentations, that King <hi>Trompart</hi> was well nigh out of his wits: within this place there was a Shepherd, of whom King <hi>Trompart</hi> required somewhat to eat, which he gave unto the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, who eat thereof, and was refreshed: and at last being come a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain unto her speech, she weeping, uttered these words: Vnhappy I above all Creatures, for I have lost my joy by accursed treason, Alas <hi>Valentine</hi> my love, cursed be he that hath seperated us. <hi>Trom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part</hi> hearing her so clamorous, reproved her roundly, saying: La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, leave off these foolish words of the Christian boy, or else I shall seperate thy head from thy body; is it not better for thee to be my wife, that am sole Lord of all this jurisdiction, then to have a beggerly start-up, that hath neither Land nor Living; and with these words he would have kissed her, but the Lady disdaining him, hit him with her fist upon the month.</p>
               <p>This strange and unlookt for disdainfulness, put King <hi>Trompart</hi> into such an anger, that he in a furious rage caught her up, and set her upon the horse again, and turning the pin the contrary way, presently, instead of carrying her into his own Country, he lighted in <hi>Inde,</hi> in the midst of a market-place, kept there that day: the people seeing such a strange sight; marvelled much thereat. The Lady <hi>Clerimond</hi> by this time, knew the horse to be <hi>Pacolets,</hi> and said: Now am I falsly betrayed, and <hi>Pacolet</hi> robbed of his horse; but my dear <hi>Valentine,</hi> he it is most sticketh at my heart, for now shall I never sée thée more. <hi>Trompart</hi> (thought for all this, that he had been in his own Country) still beating down her pite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous laments with bitter words. But mark what followed; ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings was brought to the King of <hi>Inde,</hi> of what had happened, who commanded them to be brought before him. But this fell out ill for King <hi>Trompart,</hi> for the King of <hi>Inde</hi> knew him well. King <hi>Trompart</hi> being come before the King of <hi>Inde,</hi> he bid him wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come, for you are he that put my brother to death: wherefore I will be revenged on thee, and so caused his head to be smitten off. After, the Lady was led into the Kings Pallace; where he sat in his own person, and he thus said: Lady, I know now of whence you are, by the bright splendor of your face, it hath enthralled my heart; wherefore if so you please to be my Wife, I will make
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:150341:81"/> you Queen of all this spacious continent. Sir quoth she) you sp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

Well, said the King thy answer is reasonable, let it be as thou hast said perform thy vow, and remain within my Palace, and he commanded that her attendants should be as great as if she had been his Queen; allowed her a Chamber of state, into which Chamber she caused to be brought the Wooden Horse that carried her thither, and being there, she placed if in the secretest place she could devise, and still desired she might be freed out of that danger.

As he delt with <hi>Adrimain,</hi> so he did with all round a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout him and putting off his womans attire, he clad himself in all the richest cloaths that <hi>Adrimain</hi> had, and after, with his own sword cut off his head, and bare it away with him. Having thus done, he takes his way towards the Tent of <hi>Ferragus,</hi> the which he found well guarded, and there by his Art, he also cast them all into a heavy sleep. This done, he entred into the Tent of <hi>Ferra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gus,</hi> where he suddenly made him leap out of his bed, and cloath him: and tying him in his girdle, made him run by his side like a Spaniel, till he came even to the very entrance of the gates of <hi>Aqu tain.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>When <hi>Pacolet</hi> was come to the gates of the Palace, he found there the Duke himself, accompanied with many of his Barons, and espying <hi>Pacolet,</hi> they said unto him: Where is <hi>Clerimond,</hi> that thou bringest not her again? he answered: Lords, be patient a while. I cannot shew you all at once: know this, I am fully revenged on <hi>Adrimain,</hi> for here I have brought his head, and here is <hi>Ferragus,</hi> who by my Art I have also surprized, as you may see. Then said <hi>Orson,</hi> you have done very well. Nay Lords, more yet have I to say, which is, I have enchanted asleep the whole host of <hi>Ferragus,</hi> therefore if ever you mean to have a resistless victory, go now. What say you, my Lords (quoth <hi>Orson</hi>) methinks <hi>Pacolet</hi> hath w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="155" facs="tcp:150341:82"/> lay before them, and put <hi>Ferragus</hi> into a most filthy, dark, and loathsom Prison, until their return.</p>
               <p>After this great slaughter was ended, the Duke returned again into <hi>Aquitain,</hi> and there commanded to have the G<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>hom the Duke thus said: <hi>Ferragus,</hi> if thou wilt here forsake thy <hi>Mahomet,</hi> and receive Baptism, then thou shalt live: which if thou refuse to do, thou shalt surely dye. Know (said <hi>Ferragus</hi>) I had rather suffer a thousand deaths: so he was suddenly beheaded. After his death <hi>Orson</hi> took leave of the Duke, and went towards <hi>Constantinople,</hi> to aid his Father the <hi>Grecian</hi> Emperor, and his Vncle King <hi>Pepin</hi> of <hi>France,</hi> against the unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving Sarazens, that had strongly besieged that City, but a little before his departing the Duke said thus to him: Worthy Knight, sith you are resolved to depart, I will go along with <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ou, and bear you company. <hi>Orson</hi> was very joyful to hear him say so, and gave him thanks (so taking some small time to set things in a readiness, he committed the keeping of the City, to a worthy and valiant Kt. who brought them on towards their journey. But by the way the Empress <hi>Bellysant</hi> much lamented the hard usage of her Lord, but <hi>Orson</hi> pittying her, said: Mother, leave of your tears, and only joy in that you have been falsly accused, which now will much encrease your honour: But I fear most our entrance into the City, which, as I hear, is much troubled with Sarazens. Nay (said <hi>Pacolet</hi>) fear not that, for I will work a device to enter, and my self will go before and tell them so. Do so said <hi>Orson</hi>) and tell <hi>Valentine</hi> the hard fortunes of <hi>Clerimond:</hi> Nay, (quoth <hi>Pacolet,</hi> not I) I will be no bearer of such sad tydings.</p>
               <p>Now King <hi>Pepin</hi> and the Emperor being strongly besieged, were in great distress for victuals within the City, and there was no way to be relieved, but by the sword. Then <hi>Valentine</hi> knowing their great necessity, acompanied with the Green Knight, and a worthy band of Souldiers issued out of <hi>Constantinople,</hi> and charged upon 200 Chariots of Victuals of the Pagans, and recovered the same with the death of all those that attended upon them. Having gotten this booty, they made their return towards <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantinople,</hi> thinking to recover the City, but they were begirt

But all this valour little availed, for in the end they were both taken Prisone<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>s, and led before the Soldan; who having them in his possession, assembled fifteen Pagan Knights to adjudge them to death. <hi>Valentine</hi> being thus in bonds, greatly lamented the woful state of the Lady <hi>Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rimond,</hi> taking leave both of his Father, Mother, Brother, and the rest, saying: I must now forsake you all, and never again behold your faces. The Green Knight seeing him so pasionate, said: Let us dye in a good case, and welcome death.</p>
               <p>Now was the Soldan set in his chair of State, to proceed to Iudgement: in the mean space, in comes <hi>Pacolet,</hi> in the midst of the throng, not known of any, and come and stood before the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment seat, and knéeling down, said: Right dear Sir, know I am a Messenger from your Brother <hi>Gordart,</hi> the great King of <hi>Argier,</hi> who to your succour hath brought along with him four might Kings, and by me requireth, on which part of your Army they shall be ranked. Again he prays you, if you have any Christian Prisoners, to send them him, and he will send them into his own Country, to draw the plough, and here stands a couple of fit instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments for that purpose. The Soldan rejoyced at these tydings, and commanded he should be highly feasted for that night: mean time <hi>Valentine</hi> and the Green Knight were glad of <hi>Pacolets</hi> company. In the dead time of the night, <hi>Pacolet</hi> went unto them, and giving to each of them a horse, unbound them, and bad them follow him. Being out of the enemies reach, <hi>Pacolet</hi> said thus unto them: Lords, be comforted, for in this Land is assembled the Duke of <hi>Aquitain,</hi> and the Knight <hi>O<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

               <pb n="157" facs="tcp:150341:83"/>
               <p>Then <hi>pacolet</hi> advised them all to go into the City of <hi>Const<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

In the mean space I will on the other side so bestir my self, that the Hoast of the warlike Duke, shall come up, and give a fresh assault.

               <p>
                  <hi>Pacolet</hi> (said <hi>Valentine</hi>) thou hast well advised, and so it shall be effected. Thus they departed; <hi>pacolet</hi> took his way to the Duke of <hi>Aqu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>oles,</hi> there is yet one thing more to be done, and that is this, that to morrow in the morning, we assail the Hoast of the Sarazens on the one side, and they of <hi>Constantinople</hi> on the other side, and so by that means we shall overthrow them quite. For all that comes on your part, shall be thought to come to aid the Sarazens. Then did the D. draw up his men in order, &amp; so kept themselves that night.</p>
               <p>The next morning the Emperor &amp; K. <hi>pepin</hi> diligently brought forth their men to the fight, and divided their Host into five Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tels. The first was delivered to <hi>Valentine,</hi> the second to the Gréen Knight the third to King <hi>pepin,</hi> the fourth to <hi>Millan Daugler,</hi> and the fifth to <hi>Sampson</hi> of <hi>Orleance,</hi> one that bare in his banner a Bear of Silver: At the break of day, these powers issued out of the City, to give an assault upon the enemy: being come into the field; they sounded their instruments, the noise thereof so affrighted the Sarazens, that they ran out of their Tents, crying, an allarum, an allarum. This battel was extream hot for the Christians that day, yet the enemy had no cause to boast, K <hi>pepin</hi> behaved himself so valiantly, and cryed out to his Souldiers, <hi>S. Denis, S. Denis.</hi> Then a Sarazen cryed out to the Soldan, to retire, for the safeguard of their lives, for this night have we lost our two Prisoners and also there is coming against us a new supply of a great Army. Then the Souldan thought that he had béen betrayed, but yet he made forwards, &amp; rouzed up their courage doubly, insomuch that they inforced the Christians to fall back: but little availed their pride, for there came upon them the D. of <hi>Aquitain</hi> with his forces, and assaulted them so fiercely, that they put to the sword all that did
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:150341:84"/> come before them, and thus the Christians conquered.</p>
               <p>When the battel was ended, and the Christians had recovered up their scattered forces, <hi>Valentine</hi> &amp; <hi>Orson</hi> came before the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror, doing unto him dutiful reverence. Father (quoth <hi>Valentine</hi>) here you may behold my Brother <hi>Orson,</hi> whom as yet you never knew, then the Emperor imbraced him with tears, and so did the worthy King <hi>Pepin</hi> also. Fair Son (said the Emperor) you are welcome, for by you my joys are doubled. Then assembled toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Emperor, King <hi>Pepin Valentine, O<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

               </p>
               <p>By this time they are come, when the Emperor saw his wife <hi>Bellysant,</hi> he leapt off his horse, and in tears and sighs, not being able to speak, he embraced her: and <hi>Valentine</hi> and <hi>Orson</hi> bare them company in their lamentations, so did also many of the rest there assembled. At last words took place, and the Emperor re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted all the hard dealings that had proceeded against the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press, requiring pardon for what was past. My Lord (quoth she) since it hath so pleased the Fates to bring me unto your sight, I freely forgive all wrongs, but I long to see the man that proved my inocency with his sword. Love (quoth the Emperor) this is he by whom your honor was preserved. Sir (quoth the Lady) you ought to be regarded for your service to the Empire of <hi>Greece,</hi> and King of <hi>France.</hi> For which I make you my Chamberlain, &amp; give you yearly a thousand marks in gold. Lady, I thank your bounty, and will attend you during life. Then (said <hi>Valentine</hi>) mother I pray tell me some tydings of <hi>Clerimond.</hi> Fair son, <hi>Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rimond</hi> hath been stoln from <hi>Aquitain,</hi> and given to King <hi>Trom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part,</hi> that came to the Pagans aid. <hi>Valentine</hi> hearing this, lookt strangely upon <hi>Pacolet,</hi> thinking that he had deceived him, and would have smitten him, but <hi>Pacolet</hi> entreated him to be patient, for an Enchanter hath stollen my Horse away, but I am revenged on him, by cutting off his head. <hi>Valentine</hi> understanding these misfortunes and that every one was innocent, grew into bitter passions for his loss.</p>

               <p>THese wars thus ended, K. <hi>Pepin</hi> took his leave of the Emperor and returned into <hi>France. Orson</hi> would néeds go along with his Vncle <hi>Pepin,</hi> and spend the remainder of his days in his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice. The K. was content, &amp; said unto him, I will make you high Constable of <hi>France,</hi> moreover, if it so chance that my young son <hi>Charles</hi> should decease before me, I will make you K. of <hi>France.</hi> I thank you gracious Vncle, and you shall find me faithful, and along with me will I bear the Lady <hi>Fezon:</hi> the day of taking leave came, and each embraced other with kisses and tears. But <hi>Valen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine</hi> could not rest, for he had lost his love: wherefore I am resol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to séek my love, for whom I endangered my life, and by my sword I won her; her I bewail, &amp; her will I recover again if she be alive: but if I find her not, short and woful will be my days, &amp; so he called <hi>Pacolet</hi> to him, and said: Wilt thou serve me, and be my Companion in this unknown task? Sir (quoth he) willingly, and am ready whensoever you shall set forward. Then <hi>Valentine</hi> made all things in a readiness for his departure, and now hath ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken Sea and left his Crown and Country, only accompanied with thrée attendants. Now leave we him, and speak of King

                  <hi>Pepin,</hi> who by this time is seated in <hi>

                     </gap>aris,</hi> and was honourably re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived: But above all, the valiant <hi>Orson</hi> was highly estéem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, insomuch that he had even all the comand of the Kingdom delivered over unto him. If ought was to be brought before the King, <hi>O<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>son</hi> was the man to be sued unto.</p>
               <p>This greatness of <hi>Orson</hi> fretted <hi>Haufray</hi> and <hi>Henry</hi> (of whom you have heard before) to the heart, insomuch that they plotted a means how to take away his life, saying, it was much to their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignity that <hi>Orson</hi> should be thus preferred before them, being sons unto the King: surely, says the one to the other, his glory can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not long endure, for his own pride will be his overthrow. I but (said <hi>Haufray</hi>) understand me, we have two Nephews, sons unto our eldest sister, to wit, <hi>Florence</hi> and <hi>Garnier,</hi> these are both hardy &amp; fierce, and by them methink some plot might be set on foot: again, they are fit members to execute any villany, for one is Butler un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the King, the other is Vsher unto his private Chamber: now either of these may enter into the Kings Chamber, and murther him in his bed, and such a deed being done, it will surely be laid to <hi>Orsons</hi> charge, for he onely hath the guard of his person. If this can be effected, <hi>Orson</hi> will surely be condemned to death, and the Realm wholly light into our hands. In this it is necessary to use secrecy.</p>
               <p>Vpon this resolution, they sent for these two instruments of murther to acquaint them with the treason, and being come <hi>Hau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fray</hi> said unto them: Sirs, I and my Brother have laid a plot to do us good, and raise you to honour, which thing we chuse rather to offer unto you, for that you are allied unto us, and therefore we respect you before other. This it is, you know our Father the K<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>cended from our Vncle, determine to put our doting Father to death &amp; so we may share the Land into our own government. This thing by us first plotted, were fitest to be exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted by one of you, and I think you, <hi>Garnier,</hi> to be the fitest for it, because you being Vsher in the Kings Chamber, you may convey your self behind some Arras, and when the King is in Bed mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther him. This being done, when it shall be known that the King
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:150341:85"/> is slain, the fact will be said upon <hi>Orson,</hi> for he only hath the charge of his body, and so we shall quickly get him adjudged to death; and as for little <hi>Charles,</hi> we shall do well enough to make him away-Vncle (said <hi>Garnier</hi>) doubt not, but that I shall undertake this en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprize. Shortly after, <hi>Garnier</hi> on a night, when the King was at supper, got a knife, and secretly entred into the Kings Chamber, and hid himself behind the Hangings. When the hour of y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> Kings going to bed came, he was attended by his Guard, and Chamber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lain, as the manner was: the King being laid, every man de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted, save only <hi>Orson,</hi> who conferred with the King t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>he fell asleep: <hi>Orson</hi> seeing the King asleep, without making noise, left him, and laid himself down upon a Pallat by him.</p>
               <p>The dead time of the night was come, wherein <hi>Garnier</hi> assayed (having the knife ready) this bloody enterprize: but being come to the beds side, ready to lift up his arm to strike the fatal stroak, he thought the King would awaken, and so trembling for fear laid him down by the beds side, and durst not stir: Anon he would ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture again, but being (as before) possest with fear, he put the knife within the bed, then he returned to the place from whence he came. <hi>Orson</hi> all the while slept soundly, misdoubting nothing, but yet was troubled with a frightful dream, which was, that one would have robbed his wife of honour: also he thought, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side a river he saw two Herrons, who fought with a Hawk but the Hawk defended her self so valiantly, as he had slain the two Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rons, had they not been assisted by a multitude of little birds, and the Herrons likewise had slain the Hawk, but that an Eagle rescu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him.</p>
               <p>At this Dream <hi>Orson</hi> awaked and was much astonied thereat, saying: The Gods preserve my Brother <hi>Valentine</hi> from Treasons. By this time the day broke and <hi>Orson</hi> softly stole out of the cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, fearing to awaken the King.

After came the Heraulds and the Serge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ants of the field, to clear the place. Now <hi>Haufray</hi> had provided 3000 men hard by, and given them command, that as soon as they heard him blow his horn, they should set forwards towards him.

               <p>Again <hi>Orson</hi> made towards <hi>Garnier,</hi> and striking off his ear, said: Fair Master, I would be loath you should lose by the bargain. Here began a fresh Combat between these three Champions,

                  <hi>Garnier</hi> having recovered again his Helm, came upon <hi>Orson</hi> with all his force, thinking to have left some mark of that encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, but had not his Brother relieved him, he had soon been slain. Thus <hi>Orson</hi> had enough to do with these two, for they were of stout courage, and beside they relyed much upon rescue from <hi>Haufray</hi> and <hi>Henry,</hi> but still <hi>Orson</hi> followed, &amp; at last so wounded <hi>Garnier,</hi> that he was fain to forsake his horse. Being on the ground he smote at <hi>Orsons</hi> horse, insomuch that he cut off one of his legs, and felled him to the earth, but <hi>Orson</hi> being light and strong, leapt from off his back, and being on the ground, he came and took <hi>Garnier</hi> between his arms so strongly, that he took away his Shield, and threw him on the earth, but as he would have wounded him in the belly, <hi>Florent</hi> came upon <hi>Orson,</hi> and gave such a stroak on his Helm, that he made him stagger; <hi>Orson</hi> vexed hereat, smote him so, that he overthrew his horse dead to the earth, and after took off his Helm. <hi>Florent</hi> was so ashamed hereat, that he ran up and down the field, covering his head with his shield, and <hi>Orson</hi> took pleasure in chasing of him, so <hi>Florent</hi> (said his brother) flye not, return, or we shall be vanquished, &amp; herewithal they made a fresh encounter upon <hi>Orson,</hi> &amp; with their swords laid on so lusti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that the stroaks entred his Armor, and drew blood, <hi>Orson</hi> feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing himself wounded, smote off one of <hi>Florents</hi> arms: but yet he gave not over. <hi>Orson</hi> espying him making a blow at him, made as if he would have struck at <hi>Garnier,</hi> but suddenly withdrawing his arm, hit <hi>Florent</hi> in such wise, that he fell down dead to the earth; and after said unto <hi>Garnier:</hi> Traitor, thou shalt after except thou confess the Treason. Not so <hi>Orson,</hi> for I will be revenged on thée for my Brother death; <hi>Haufray</hi> and <hi>Henry</hi> disliked the match, and said; one of our Nephews is slain, and if he overcome the other, he will cause him to confess the Treason, and thereby bring us in danger. Brother (said <hi>Haufray</hi>) I will tell you what may be done: as soon as we perceive <hi>Garnier</hi> to be overcome, before he confess any thing we will enter the field, and make as if we came to chear up <hi>Orson,</hi> and we will cut off our Nephews head, and so the trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son shall not be known.

The King bound it with an Oath that he would, for there were never any yet returned alive that attempted it. Sir (qd. <hi>Valentine</hi>) let me have about or two with this Monster. Then he caused a Shield to be made, and thereon fastned a great number of long spickes of stéel, a foot long, as sharp as needles.</p>

Then went <hi>Valen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine</hi> to his helm, thinking to have put it on again, but suddenly the beast came flying down and he was fain to cover his head with his shield, which the Dragon espying, returned again to the rock. Then <hi>Pacolet</hi> put on <hi>Valentines</hi> helm, and said: Sir; I am sore wounded, and must of necessity return to the City, to get some re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief, for my heart faileth: so they took leave Assoon as the Dragon saw him a great way off, she assailed <hi>Valent<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="170" facs="tcp:150341:90"/> wherewith she fell to the earth. <hi>Valentine</hi> still pursued his stroaks, and ran his Ax so far in her throat that she fell down dead. <hi>Valen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>t ne</hi> having thus overcome the dragon, the King called unto him, and said; Of all Knights thou art the most hardiest, for by thy valour is our City delivered of a fearful enemy, that hath much damaged us: With these words they entred the City, and so to the Palace, where a solemn feast was held: Then the King caused <hi>Valentines</hi> wounds to be carefully healed. The Queen likewise highly honoured him, for she was enamoured on him so hotly, that for to gain his Love, she would have wrought the death of the King her husband.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Valentine</hi> having well refreshed himself, and healed his wounds within the City of <hi>Antioch,</hi> he said unto the King: Sir, you re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member your promise, that you and your people would receive Baptism if I overcame the Dragon; you see she is slain by me only. True (qd. the King) and look what I promised I will per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form: and thereupon sent this present edict throughout the Land, that every one should forsake <hi>Mahomet,</hi> &amp; be baptized. The Quéen sent for <hi>Valentine</hi> to her Chamber, who presently went to her, and said: Lady, I am come at your command, and ready to do you service. Ah, said the Lady, thou art of great hardiness, wisdom, strength, and all the Beatitudes belonging to a famous Warrior, happy is the Lady that shall enjoy thy love: O that I were not a woman, or a woman not under subjection, O! I could love thée be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond humane reason, hadst thou but so much liberty as to imbrace me, or to grant me love. Lady I thank you, but you have wedded a puissant King, and him only ought you to love &amp; honour. Kt. 'tis true, I have been ever constant to him, but since I first beheld thée all my thoughts are captivated. <hi>Valentine</hi> seeing the Queen so eager, replyed: Lady, if the King should but know or suspect me I should surely be put to death. Again, he is old, you young, rest your self content till I return from my intended journey, to the holy Sepulchre, and then if the King be dead, I willingly give my self unto you. Hereupon she played the part of many women, that are weary of their husbands for the love of others. Even so began this Queen to practise, for one night, as the Queen was going to bed, a cup of wine was brought unto her (as the custom was) where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:150341:90"/> she had conveyed poyson, and after presented it unto the King: but he having some doubt thereof disliked it, saying; Lady look what drink you have brewed, either drink it your self, or tell me what you have put into it.

I do believe thée, qd. the King, and pardon thee: so they lay together that night; but she still requested that <hi>Valentine</hi> might be put to death. He shall as sure as I live, qd. the King. She hearing the King say so, was very sorrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, and secretly calling one of her Maidens, sent to <hi>Valentine</hi> to tell him her will, and what the King had decreed against him: <hi>Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lentine</hi> hearing of this accusation, whereof he was innocent, said: What will not a woman undertake? now for the love of the Quéen must I depart like a Traitor, or else lay her shame open to the World: well I will rather depart with dishonour to my self then her. And therewithal calling up his attendants, before the morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing be departed the City, and came to the Sea-side, where lay a shipfull of passengers ready to put off, in amongst the rest goes he and his company, so hoisting sails they departed. On the morrow, when the King was up, he caused all his Nobles to be assembled, and said unto them: Lords, I am most deceived in the man whom I trusted, and he whom in heart I held dearest, hath betrayed me; <hi>Valentine</hi> I mean, who for to gain the lawless love of my Quéen, hath stirred her up to poyson me; therefore let us proceed to judge him to some shameful death.</p>
               <p>Amongst the rest, an aged wise Baron, said: We have no reason to proceed against an offender, without calling him to answer: Again, were he never so great an offender, we ought to hear him. Whereupon <hi>Valentine</hi> was sent for; but instead of <hi>Valentine</hi> came his host, who told them <hi>Valentine</hi> was gone before the break of the day from his house, but whither he knew not. The King hearing this, suddenly sent forth men to follow and pursue him, but all in vain, for he was past their reach on the Sea.</p>
               <p>Shortly after that the K of <hi>Antioch</hi> was converted, his wives Father <hi>Brandiffer</hi> a Turk had so great a spleen against the King, for altering his Religion, that he sent to him for his daughter <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zamond.</hi> When the K. heard his unjust demand, he gain-said him:
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:150341:91"/> hereupon <hi>Brand ffer</hi> came upon him with an 100000 Pagans, and besieged his City: At last within the compass of four months, by treason he obtained it, took the King Prisoner, and suddenly put him to death, and Crowned himself King of <hi>Antioch.</hi> This done, he returned into his Realm, but as he was on the Seas, by a Tempest he was forced into the Land of <hi>Greece,</hi> into a little City called <hi>Cretophe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Within this City by chance was the Emperor of <hi>Greece</hi> newly arrived then, and he and the Gréen Knight, with some other com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany rid forth to sport themselves, not knowing of the Pagans being there, fell into the hands of <hi>Brandiffers</hi> Souldiers, and having gotten them hasted towards the gates of the City, thinking to have seized the whole City, but they found it manfully defended.</p>
               <p>The men of <hi>Cretophe</hi> were very sorrowful for the loss of the Emperor and the Green Knight. At last they determined to send Letters unto <hi>Bellysant</hi> of what had hapned, and to demand aid a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst these Pagans. The Lady receiving these Letters, was won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drous sad, and sending for their Captains and men of War, made preparation for a spéedy revenge. Also she sent for her Son <hi>Orson,</hi> and craved aid of her brother King <hi>Pepin.</hi> Being thus in readiness, they were sent to the succour of the Emperor: But <hi>Brandiffer</hi> had scouts abroad to give him notice of all that hapned, and fearing the forces of the <hi>Greeks,</hi> and their prisoners loss, they stole to the sea-side, so taking ship, they in short time arrived at <hi>Lize,</hi> in which place they took a Castle, wherein was kept his two Daughters, <hi>Rozamond</hi> and <hi>Galazy,</hi> who for her beauty had been demanded of fourteen Kings. <hi>Brandiffer</hi> had yet no meaning to marry her, wherefore he caused her to be kept within this Castle, for it was the strongest in the Land: for it had a Bridge made by such cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Art, that but one could pass at a time: at the end of this Bridge two fierce Lyons stood to kéep the entry into this Castle: The Lady <hi>Galazy</hi> was kept in a Dungeon, under which was a Cave, wherein the Emperor and the Green Knight, with other Christians, which had been there a long time, were put.

               <p>YOu have heard already of the death of King <hi>Trompart,</hi> who stole away the Lady <hi>Clerimond</hi> upon <hi>Pacolets</hi> horse: also how she got pardon for one whole year before she would marry. Now is the time expired, and all this while appeareth no succour for her relief, which she had so long expected: Therefore (poor Lady) now is she put to her shifts, and to save her Maiden-head, she feigned her self very sick. This news came to the Kings ear, that the fair <hi>Clerimond</hi> was extream sick, at which he grew very sad, and came to visit her, at last he would have put his hand upon her head, to have held it, but she refusing, took his arm, and lift up her head her self, making signs that she would bite him, at which action he wondred, and grew much astonied thereat.</p>
               <p>After this she rowle her eyes up and down, and made grive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous faces, in such wise, that the King got him out of the Chamber, fearing lest she should prove mad. In this manner she abode a long time, and she did act the matter so well, that within fifteen days she seemed more like a beast then a woman: she made all her At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendants forsake her, for if she caught them, she would leave some mark behind her, so they left her alone, giving her meat at the window, for none would come near her. One while she put her smock upermost, anon she bedawbed her face with foot, and in this estate the King came and beheld her, lamenting her distemper, and
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:150341:92"/> said unto her: Lady, now is the time come that I should have had you to wife, therefore be comforted, and be not thus impatient.</p>
               <p>The Lady understanding him well made shew as if she would hear him, but then she fell into a stronger fit of madness; one while she would run against the chimney, another while fall into a great laughter, then sit down and make faces, and all to preserve her chastity. Many ways was tryed for her recovery, yet none pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed: so leave we her in her chamber, and return to <hi>Valentine,</hi> who with an ardent desire is roved abroad, accompanied with <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>colet,</hi> to find out the Lady <hi>Clerimond.</hi> Long have they travelled to find out the Lady <hi>Clerimond,</hi> and now were they arrived in <hi>Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clardy,</hi> which was the Kingdom of <hi>Tro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

Being in the City, they asked for K. <hi>Trompart,</hi> so they told him he was slain by the King of <hi>Inde,</hi> and that now at this present, <hi>Lucar</hi> his Son would revenge his death upon the King of <hi>Inde,</hi> and to that end he had newly mustred up his powers, and waged many royal Kings to undertake this war. Then spake <hi>Pacolet,</hi> who well understood the language, saying; Of what account is this K. <hi>Lucar?</hi> for the host where he lay told him, that he should shortly marry with the daughter of <hi>Brandiffer,</hi> that was late wife to the King of <hi>Antioch,</hi> who was slain by <hi>Brandiffer,</hi> for that he forsook his Religion.</p>
               <p>At this tale <hi>Valentine</hi> was much abashed, and wondred at this sudden alteration: but at last he said; Know ye not what is become of the Lady that King <hi>Trompart</hi> did bring with him? Of her we hear no tydings (quoth the Host:) tell me then where is K. <hi>Lucar</hi> at this present, I would fain serve under him for wages, for my money is fallen short, and I have a great desire to follow the wars. Marry, said the Host, King <hi>Lucar</hi> is in <hi>Esclardy,</hi> and there you shall find him accompanied with a huge Hoast, and attendeth <hi>Brand ffer</hi> to receive his daughter in Wedlock. <hi>Valentine</hi> know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all this, he hoped to hear of <hi>Clerimond;</hi> and so he departed, and came to <hi>Esclardy,</hi> to serve King <hi>Lucar.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Lucar</hi> being in the City of <hi>Esclardy,</hi> thither came <hi>Brandiffer</hi> with his daughter, at sight of whom K. <hi>Lucar</hi> was joyful, but the Lady was sad, for of all other she could never affect him. The La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy was led into the Hall, and there married unto King <hi>Lucar.
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:150341:92"/> Valentine</hi> was abroad, and entring a wood, he heard the crying voice of a woman, whom a Sarazen would have ravished: <hi>Valen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ne</hi> still heard the cry, and said unto <hi>Pacolet:</hi> Ride faster, for this cry is more and more in my ear, and we shall do a charitable deed, in relieving the opressed. Sir, said <hi>Pacolet,</hi> meddle not in this matter, for you know not what danger you may be drawn into.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Pacolet,</hi> thou speakest foolishly for he is not worthy the name of a Knight, that will not aid in time of necessity: so he rode up and down the wood, till at last he lighted on the Sarazen, that had gotten a Lady under him. Then <hi>Valentine</hi> said: My friend, forsake your Lady, or else betake you to your arms, and combat with me, for you may well perceive she loveth you not. By <hi>Mahomet,</hi> quoth the Pagan, I accept of this thy challenge, and will make thee know that in an evil hour camest thou hither. These words past, he left the Lady, and mounted his horse, and then took his shield and spear, and being prepared, they set out one at the other so fiercely, that <hi>Valentine</hi> ran his spear quite through the body of the Pagan, insomuch as he fell down dead. Then went <hi>Valentine</hi> to the maiden, saying; Damosel, now is your enemy laid in the dust, but I pray shew me the cause why this man brought you into this wood: Sir, I will tell nothing save the truth: So it was, that yesternight late he came into my fathers house to lodge, and there attempting the use of my body, but could not, he departed from me, and went into the Chamber of my Father, and there flew him. Afterward he thought he should surely have got his will on me, in this manner as you see, from which by your manhood I am freed, and mine honour saved, do with me what pleaseth you, for your body hath ransomed mine, and besides, as you have won me, I yield me to your pleasure.</p>
               <p>Damosel, by me thou shall receive no wrong, return unto your house, and keep well your chastity. So <hi>Valentine</hi> left the Maiden, and took his way towards <hi>Escalrdy.</hi> This slain Pagan had cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Attendants which were gone to seek him, and as soon as they found him dead, they told his misfortune to the Kieg, sa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

So had I Lady (quoth <hi>Valentine</hi>) as great a desire to see you for since I saw you, I understand your Husband is dead, and that you are newly married again. Lady, you know that for the love of you, within <hi>Antioch</hi> I sustained much danger of life: 'Tis true (said the Lady) and I acknowledge my self guilty, and it grew only out of love to you. But now hath my father bestowed me to K. <hi>Lucar,</hi> who is rich above measure, yet can I not fancy him he is a perfideous Traitor, and since you entred this Palace, he grows so jealous of you, that he sends you into <hi>Inde,</hi> trusting you shall never return: for never yet any came back again alive: but I will circumvent him, and set you free from danger: Therefore

Now to the end he shall not find your words to be in vain, bear him this King.

So taking his leave, he went to K. <hi>Lucar,</hi> who allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him ten Marriners to conduct him over an arm of the Sea, that lyeth betwéen <hi>Esclardy</hi> and <hi>Inde,</hi> so that having a prosperous wind, the next morning they arrived at a Port two miles from the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace of the K. of <hi>Inde.</hi> Then <hi>Valentine</hi> being arrived, he drew forth his horse out of the Ship, and backed him, and said unto the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riners: Abide here till my return, for it shall not be long e're I be dispatched.

As he came up the Hall, the King saluted him with a wrinkled brow, and thought he was a Messenger of K. <hi>Lucar,</hi> and therefore said
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:150341:94"/> aloud unto him: Art thou not a servant of King <hi>Lucars?</hi> Sir (said <hi>Valentine</hi>) I am, and bring you such tydings as will fret your heart; but on the other side▪ I bring such gladsom news, that your very heart will leap to hear it from the fair <hi>Rozamond.</hi> Messenger, know this that in the spight of K. <hi>Lucar</hi> thou shouldst have suffered death, but for the love and reverence I owe unto that Lady, thou shalt rece<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

Yes, said <hi>Valentine,</hi> that I shall shew you, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver my message with such applause, that I will not swerve from the truth thereof. That I belong to K. <hi>Lucar,</hi> you know, who by me sendeth these words, that for the death of his Father, you must come and yield to his mercy, with a rope about your neck, as a man guilty of so f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Messenger, I understand thee, and set light by these his bold threats: and for answer to this mater, thou shalt have Letters, wherein shall be explained how little we regard his menaces, and also how ready I am to receive his forces, that shall come to whip my Land: there leave thou these proud brags, and return to that thou hast to say, concerning the fair Lady <hi>Rozamond,</hi> for I most of all desire to hear from her. Sir (said <hi>Valentine</hi>) on her beehalf I salute you as her Love, and she sendeth you word that she is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst her will married to King <hi>Lucar,</hi> whom she never loved. Again the poor Lady is so burthened with love towards <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ou, that if she might have her will, you should soon perceive, that none should enjoy her, but you, if you be so content.</p>
               <p>Now to come yet somewhat nearer, she told me, that she will come hither in the company of the King her husband, when he ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth up arms to invade you, and then may you find other means to accomplish your desire, even as you would. By <hi>Mahomet,</hi> says the <hi>Indian</hi> King, this pleaseth me exceedingly. Sir, (said <hi>Valentine</hi>) whether these come from a true heart or no, I cannot say, but for token that all is true that I have said, receive here the ring which you gave unto her, and though women prove variable, yet methinks she speaks to you from her inward breast. Friend (quoth he) this
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:150341:94"/> is the same ring indeed, and my heart is overcome with joy, go thy ways in, and take thy repast, while in the mean time I get the Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters ready thou shalt take with thee to answer this defiance.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Valentine</hi> went in as the King commanded, and was highly feasted, and he still demanded after <hi>Clerimond,</hi> but could not hear of her. By this time came the King, and delivered unto him the Letters, and <hi>Valentine</hi> taking his leave of him, knew not that his love was in the Court, who abode many evil days for the love of him, and still desired to hear some news of him. In the end he shall <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

               <p>
                  <hi>Valentine</hi> made great hast to be freed out of <hi>Inde,</hi> and taking horse, he came to Haven, where the Marriners stayed, at his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Marriners were amazed, and thought that he had not done his Message: Masters (quoth <hi>Valentine</hi>) fear nothing, for I have accomplished my message, and I am safely returned. Then the Marriners said, we much marvel thereat.</p>
               <p>At these words he took Ship, and on the morrow they were in <hi>Esclardy. Valentine</hi> made no stay, but as soon as he was descended his horse, he went to the Palace of the King, finding him there ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied with K. <hi>Bra<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

This Letter being broken open, they found <hi>Valentines</hi> words to be true. King <hi>Brandiffer</hi> understanding his answer, swore by all the Gods, that he would never return home again, but with victory, or loss of life.</p>
               <p>The next morrow they betook them to the seas, with an hoast of 200000 Sarazens. So the King carried <hi>Rozamond</hi> along with him, and they were quickly there. Being landed, they pitched their
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:150341:95"/> Tents in a pleasant field before the City, whilst they of the City made fast the Gates. The King himself got up into a high Tower to behold their order, so by the river side he might espy their rich pavillions, gallantly furnished with arms and streamers: then the King called unto him certain Heralds of Arms, to know by those Arms, whose Tents they were. The first (quoth he) is <hi>Brandiffers,</hi> the second is <hi>Lucars,</hi> and the third is <hi>Rozamonds</hi> with her Ladies. When the King understood that <hi>Rozamond</hi> was there, his heart leapt for joy, and said: It is no time to sleep now, he that will have the love of a fair Lady, must venture life and goods, or else he is not worthy of her, that will take no pains. Hereupon resolving, he presently put his men in battel array, and suddenly issued out of the City upon his enemies, so that they were not in a readiness, for they little thought the <hi>Indian</hi> had been so fierce, but love made him do it.</p>
               <p>When the King saw <hi>Brandiffer</hi> ordering his men in Battel ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ray, he left his companies, with much dilligence he rode towards y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> Pavillion of the Ladies: Now when <hi>Rozamond</hi> beheld it was he, she gave all the rest of her company the slip, and ran violently into his arms, who joyfully received her. The <hi>Indian</hi> perceiving her good will, got her up behind him, and putting spurs to his horse, she said; My love is fixed only on you, and for your love have I long mourned, for I never hated man so much as I did King <hi>Lucar,</hi> but now I pray thée, let me bid him farewel, and I will kéep my self on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to thée so long as I live: Lady (quoth the <hi>Indian</hi>) doubt not, for I will not fail you, and here I vow, e're three days pass, you shall be Quéen of <hi>India,</hi> and Mistriss of all my Lands. These words passed as he was riding away with the Lady <hi>Rozamond.</hi> At last the guard of the Maidens came out of the Pavilion, and ran to the King, saying: My Lord, there is evil tydings, for this day you have lost your fair Lady <hi>Rozamond,</hi> for the King of <hi>Inde,</hi> your utter e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy hath stolen her hence, and is ridden away with her, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore quickly send your men of War, and follow him, that they may save the honour of your Queen. Hold your peace (said <hi>Lucar</hi>) and talk no more, for he that hath an evil wife, it is well if he can be so rid of her; although he had a heavy heart. After this he went to K. <hi>Brandiffer,</hi> and said: Sir, I have small joy of your daughter, who
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:150341:95"/> hath eir me, to run away with a stranger, and one that is min enemy, leaving me in reproach and shame. Fair Son (said <hi>Bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>differ</hi>) be not discontent at me, for to day I will be rebenged on him that carried her. So putting spurs to his horse, rid after him, gathered a great company of men. Amongst the rest, <hi>Valentine</hi> was one, willing to shew his fidelity, said unto <hi>Pacolet,</hi> now shew me by thy Art somewhat. Then <hi>Pacolet</hi> raised such a Charm, which so astonied the <hi>Indians</hi> eye-sight, that it seemed to him there was nothing before his horse, but woods, bushes, and great rivers. At this he was so amazed, that he made the Lady alight; when the Queen was on the ground, she thought she should have had means to save her self with the King, but <hi>Valentine</hi> was so near her, that he said unto her: Lady abide, for you must go with me, for that you have a long time promised me your love. Ah <hi>Valentine,</hi> I ow you but little love, for once I made love unto you, and you refused me, wherefore I was forced to seek another, but seeing I am cros<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed thus, I yield my self as your Vassal, so you will make my peace with <hi>Lucar.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Lady (said <hi>Valentine</hi>) I will do my endeavour: so he led her to King <hi>Lucar,</hi> and said unto him: Sir, here is the Lady <hi>Rozamond</hi> your Wife, whom the <hi>Indian</hi> Traitor had led away against her will, for which she was right sorrowful: Sir, (qd. the Lady) he telleth you true; for even as the battel was begun, I saw one come to me, thinking it had been one of your Barons, that had come to succour me, &amp; without any further enquiry mounted on his horse; being on horse-back, I perceived that then I was betra<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ed, so I strugled and pulled him by the hair, and scratched him by the face, and forcing him to let me go, I have by the help of this good Kt. escaped. Lady (said <hi>Lucar</hi>) you have well done, and at this present we have no leisure to enquire further hereof; so he left the Lady, &amp; returned to the Battel. They of <hi>Inde</hi> returned into the City, who had lost divers valiant Leaders, but none so fretted the <hi>Indian</hi> at the heart, as did the loss of <hi>Rozamond.</hi> Alas Lady (said he) I have failed thee in thy greatest extreamity, but I was surely enchanted, and on the sudden, methought I saw Woods, Fields, and Rivers, for she was no sooner down upon the ground, but all was plain and even way before me. <hi>Valentine</hi> had great praise for getting again
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:150341:96"/> the Lady, and she shewed him a fair countenance, in that he had succoured her, but it was all feigned, for she hated him to death, and putting up this mischance, she watched her time, and in the end accomplished his desire and brought her will to execution.</p>
               <p>It is a common saying, women seldom want deceit, as here it appeareth in <hi>Rozamond,</hi> for some four days after, she rode forth of her Tent, pretending to take the air, but took her way toward the King of <hi>I<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

The King did ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to her direction: so suddenly issuing out of a Postern, he came and took her horse by the head, and carried her into the City.</p>
               <p>Hereupon began a cry throughout the host of King <hi>Lucar,</hi> that <hi>Rozamond</hi> was surprized, and she was past recovery. This mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Lucar</hi> at the heart, and gave out, that whosoever would recover her out of his hands, should be made a great Seneschal: Sir (said <hi>Pacolet</hi>) if you please to atchieve dignity, I will so work, that we will fetch her back? No, said <hi>Valent<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ne,</hi> let her go, once I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gained her, thinking that she would have been constant unto her Husband, but all was in vain. The same day that the King had her, he lay with her, and begat a Son called <hi>Rabestre,</hi> who afterward had the possession of <hi>Jerusalem. Lucar</hi> was right sorrowful for the loss of his wife, but <hi>Brandiffer</hi> his father recomforted him, saying; Son, take courage, and let us now be revenged before we depart: but it fell out otherwise, for that day came a Messenger to him, who brought him contrary tydings: which was, that King <hi>Pepin</hi> of <hi>France,</hi> and the Emperor of <hi>Greece</hi> was entred his Land, burning and spoiling many places, and were now upon the siege of <hi>Angory,</hi> in which City his Lady now lay in Child-bed: therefore you must presently take course to restrain the fury of the enemy, or else en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure such wrack as were lamentable to behold.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Brandiffer</hi> hereat amazed, went unto his son <hi>Lucar,</hi> and said, Son, here is evil tydings befallen, the <hi>French</hi> are entred my Land, wast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and destroying all things, therefore I must leave you, to look after mine own: but let me tell you what you shall do; send some Knight unto the <hi>Indian,</hi> to demand your wife, upon this condition, that you will first forget the death of your Father, and that you
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:150341:96"/> will raise your siege and be gone. Wherefore he sent <hi>Valentine</hi> unto the K. of <hi>Inde,</hi> to declare this message. He bein<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

To whom the <hi>Ind an</hi> thus replyed; If he will have a wife, he must go seek another, for he shall never again enjoy her: <hi>Valentine</hi> having thus received this answer; he departed, and come to King <hi>Lucar</hi> telling him all that the <hi>Indian</hi> had said, which grieved him to the very heart.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Lucar</hi> having by this means caused <hi>Brandiffer</hi> to stay with him: sent <hi>Valentine</hi> and <hi>Murgalant</hi> to raise the siege which King <hi>Pepin</hi> had laid against <hi>A gory.</hi> And as they were under sail, <hi>Valen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine</hi> espying a glistering Tower, asked what it might be. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>hen the Marriners described the manner and fashion of it to him. Now they were come within the sight of K. <hi>Pepin</hi>'s Tents, and <hi>Murga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lant</hi> having viewed the Christians forces, found the number to be great: then said <hi>Valentine,</hi> Let us secretly send to the City, to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint them with our coming, that to morrow morning they may issue out at that side, and we will back them on this side, that none may escape our hands. <hi>Pacolet</hi> standing by, said: Let me be the Messenger, for I can speak their Language. Quoth <hi>Murgalant;</hi> Go thy way: So <hi>Pacolet</hi> departed, but (he said to himself) by to mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row night you will sing another song. <hi>Pacolet</hi> being come to the very gates of the City of <hi>Angory,</hi> the warders thought him to be some Spy, wherefore they demanded of him, saying: Whither goes this fellow? he looks as if he were some spy: 'Tis true (quoth <hi>Pacolet</hi>) but I come not for your hurt, therefore bring me into the hoast of King <hi>Pepin,</hi> that I speak with my Lord <hi>Orson,</hi> for I have a matter of great import to acquaint him withal. So they brought him into the presence of <hi>Orson,</hi> who espying him, was right joyous, and said: How fares my Brother <hi>Valentine?</hi> Then <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>colet</hi> told him of all his adventures that he had passed since they saw one another, and also how valiantly and wonderfully he had overcome the Serpent, and how he could hear no tydings of <hi>Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rimond,</hi> and told him that they were now come to bear Arms a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst them, accompanied with 100000 Pagans, under the conduct of <hi>Valentine</hi> and <hi>Murgalant,</hi> and to chase you out of these confines,

Now <hi>Pacolet,</hi> to the end there should grow no mistrust, gave certain signs to <hi>Murga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lant.</hi> Being in the City he found out the Admiral <hi>Burnas,</hi> and sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luted him with great reverence, and delivered unto him the Mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage which he had brought from <hi>Murgalant,</hi> which was, that of <hi>Brandiffers</hi> part were new arrived 100000, and <hi>Murgalant</hi> sends you word by me, that to morrow betimes you have your men in a readiness, to assail the Christians on the one side of the City, and <hi>Murgalant</hi> will assail them on the other, thereby to hem them up, that not a man of them escape.

In the dead time of the night <hi>Pacolet</hi> went a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst the Pagans, and cast such a charm, that they fell asleep.

               <p>The assault being given on the <hi>Sarazens, Pacolet</hi> said unto <hi>Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lentine,</hi> séek to save your self, for the Christians have killed the Watch, and entred the Hoast. <hi>Pacolet</hi> (said <hi>Valentine</hi>) thou hast made me break my promise with <hi>Brandiffer,</hi> for which I shall surely dye.

               <p>But now let us return to speak somewhat of <hi>Clerimond,</hi> who was in the Court of this <hi>Indian</hi> King.

Alas for this poor Lady: Alas for <hi>Valentine,</hi> and yet to see it is my chance at last to find her out in this unlookt for adventure. After he had ended these lamentations, he said: Lady, now I do understand whom you are, and sith you trusted me with the secrets of your heart, give me leave a little al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so to shew you whom I am: Here you see me, and in what shape I go cloathed, yet know that I am <hi>Pepin</hi> K. of <hi>France,</hi> and by dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>astrous chance I am fallen in this servitude. As for <hi>Valentine,</hi> know that he undertaketh dangerous adventures, and continueth still without taking any test: Now I have knowledge of you, if between us we can make those things known to him, with great joy you may embrace each other. At these words the Lady swound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, but <hi>Pepin</hi> seeing her recovered, left her and came unto the King being at supper. So here we rest to talk any more of this matter, and return to say somewhat of <hi>Brandiffer</hi> and <hi>Lucar,</hi> who are busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in leading the twelve Peers of <hi>France</hi> to Prison.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Brandiffer</hi> having the twelve Péers in prison, and with them <hi>Haufray</hi> and <hi>Henry,</hi> the only workers of the Treason, came unto his Castle, where he told all the whole enterprize to his daughter, how the twelve Peers fell into his hand.

Every one looked for nothing but death, save only <hi>Orson,</hi> and he bear it it out comfortably, saying: Lords, let us yet trust to my Brother <hi>Valentine</hi> and <hi>Pacolet,</hi> who by inchant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment can do much, but he little knew that the Castle was impreg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable. <hi>Brandiffer</hi> having thus made all sure, called before him his daughter <hi>Galazy,</hi> and said unto her: I must depart to satisfie mine Army: being there, I shall meet with the <hi>Indian</hi> King, and <hi>Lucar,</hi> both which will aid me against the <hi>French,</hi> that holdeth the City of <hi>Angory;</hi> therefore kéep well my Prisoners, so he departed. And when he came unto his Army, he found <hi>Lucar</hi> ready; but as for the <hi>Indian</hi> King, he sent his forces, and came not himself, by reason that <hi>Rozamond</hi> was lately dead.</p>
               <p>The two Kings gathered up their Forces, and took their way towards <hi>Angory:</hi> whither being come, <hi>Valentine</hi> had knowledge thereof, who kept the City for K. <hi>Pepin.</hi> This amazed much the Noble <hi>Valentine,</hi> when he saw the Tents so nigh him: At last he cal'd <hi>Pacolet</hi> unto him, saying; I wonder I hear not of my Vncle <hi>Pepin.</hi> Fear not (said <hi>Pacolet</hi>) for e're long we will hear better news: and therewithal departed from <hi>Angory,</hi> and never rested till he came unto the Camp of K. <hi>Lucar,</hi> who espying him, demanded of him what news, and what was become of his Master, who so long time he had served: <hi>Pacolet</hi> answered: Sir, he is long since dead, and I am come to seek a new Master. Quoth <hi>Lucar,</hi> Wilt thou serve me? Yes (quoth <hi>Pacolet.</hi>) Thus was he received into his service, but he ill rewarded his new Master, for the same night by Enchantment, he cast <hi>Lucar</hi> into such a sleep, that he carried him into the City of <hi>Angory.

               <p>Now <hi>Valentine</hi> went towards the dead Corps, and took out of his bosome a pair of writing Tables, in which was written the whole manner of his Art. These Tables had <hi>P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

Valentine</hi> hearing the effect of his message, was much amazed, and said to the Messenger: How cometh it to pass, that <hi>Brandiffer</hi> can make choice of all these valiant men, how became they his Prisoners? Quoth the Messenger, I think it is not unknown, how that King <hi>Pepin,</hi> accompanied with the twelve Peers of <hi>France,</hi> not long since went to <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> and having amongst them one Traitor, was delivered into the hands of <hi>Bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>differ,</hi> and by him taken in <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> and committed to prison: Wherefore having thus related unto you the truth; said: will you
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:150341:104"/> change one prisoner for another? Messenger, I shall give answer to thee anon: so entring into the Hall, he assembled unto him all his counsel, saying to them: Thus it is, that for our prisoner <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>car,</hi> we may have delivered us, either my Father, or my Brother, or my Vncle King <hi>Pepin:</hi> now in this cause let us resolve what is to be done. The Lords replyed, you are most bound to your natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Father, and therefore we judge it most meet to release him.</p>
               <p>Lords (quoth <hi>Valentine</hi>) you have well advised, but yet I am determined to do otherwise, for you all know that my Mother was wrongfully banished, and in her exile brought me forth, and my brother in the forrest of <hi>Orleance,</hi> where we might both have béen devoured of beasts if mine Vncle K. <hi>Pepin</hi> had not taken me up.

When the Barons had heard the wisdom of <hi>Valentine,</hi> they agreed all with one voice, that he had nobly spoken. Then called they unto them the Messen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of <hi>Brandiffer,</hi> and said: Friend, return this answer to thy Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster, tell him that I shall willingly yeild the body of K. <hi>Lucar,</hi> upon condition that he deliver unto us the body of K. <hi>Pepi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

When <hi>Valentine</hi> heard this, he thanked him for his deed, and began to recount what a benefit had happened to him, that he was delivered and the rest left in bonds, for by your true loyalty to your Soveraign, you are escaped from danger. <hi>Valentine</hi> hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ended this discourse, he caused K. <hi>Lucar</hi> to be brought before him: to whom he thus said; King <hi>Lucar,</hi> for this time you are set at liberty, but if ever you happen again into my hands, I shall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member you for the death of my friend <hi>Pacolet,</hi> whom you have slain; these words being ended, he delivered him unto the Messen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers: now was <hi>Lucar</hi> delivered, and the D. <hi>Myllon</hi> restored in his room. <hi>Valentine</hi> having gathered more strength, by adding unto his powers, the Dukes company, they gathered all their scatter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Troops up into battel array &amp; with the number of 50000 fight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing men, they issued out of the City upon the enemy. <hi>Brand ffer</hi> hearing hereof, made up against him, accompanied with 24 Kings his attendants, all holding him their chief Lord, but their number was so infinite, that the Christians could not come near to do them any harm.</p>
               <p>Then <hi>Valentine</hi> resolved to give a new on set upon the Pagans, and couragiously heartning his men, he set upon that part wherein was <hi>Brandiffer</hi> and King <hi>Lucar.</hi> In the thickest of this battel, an Admiral (who was Lord of <hi>M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

At last they strove on each part which should sound retreat first, but nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther side would yield, so that the fight continued all night, till the next morning making great fires to give them light.

So <hi>Valentine</hi> retired himself out of the battel to refresh his tyred limbs. When the <hi>Indian</hi> Marshal saw their side had the worse, he by his policy withdrew his forces, &amp; in the night time stole out of sight, so that at last they betook them to their heels, and ran away.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Valentine</hi> perceiving it, told D. <hi>Myllon</hi> thereof, so they deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined that <hi>Valentine</hi> and his Troops should set upon the Marshal, which they did, and sell upon the <hi>Indians</hi> in such furious manner, that they upon their first adventure brake their battel array. The Marshal seeing it thought to have fled, but <hi>Valentine</hi> meeting him at this advantage, lent him such a wrap with his Spear, as both Horse and Man fell to the earth. Being on the ground, the Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers would have killed him, had not <hi>Valentine</hi> charged them to the contrary, and committed him to the custody of four valiant Knights.</p>
               <p>In this bickering there were many Prisoners of account sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prized &amp; taken, all which <hi>Valentine</hi> sent into <hi>Angory,</hi> to be kept in safety. By this time of the day, <hi>Brandiffer</hi> and <hi>Lucar</hi> knew that they had the worse, but they could not make resistance. At last, they resolved to return again into their own Countries, and reu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite their forces afresh. So wraping up their Ensigns, they took their flight towards the Sea-coast: and the Christians followed after, killing all that withstood them. Of all the Pagans multitudes that went into the field there escaped but 100 persons. They being gone, the Christians r<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

               <p>After the Christians had won the battel, and given burial to the dead, <hi>Valentine</hi> commanded the Prisoners to be brought before him. Amongst the rest was the Marshal of <hi>India,</hi> of whom he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:150341:106"/> if he would forsake his <hi>Mahometry?</hi> The Marshal an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered that he would sooner forsake his life. Then D. <hi>Myllon</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded of what Country he was, he said: I am a Marshal of <hi>Inde,</hi> and one whom the King loveth. Quoth D. <hi>Myllon</hi> unto <hi>Valentine,</hi> we are made happy in this Prisoner, for in exchange of him, we shall release K. <hi>Pepin,</hi> who was led away by the <hi>Indian</hi> King to be his Dwarf, when we were taken prisoners at <hi>Jerusalem.</hi> Then they demanded of him, if the King had not in his possession, a Christian of low stature: yes (qd. he) there remaineth such a one in his Court, but not as his Prisoner, and thither was he brought, when the twelve Peers of <hi>France</hi> were taken in <hi>Jerusalem.</hi> Marshal, quoth <hi>Valentine,</hi> it is he after whom we enquire, wherefore let him be brought hither and delivered to us, and you shall he set at liberty, for he is a Page whom I ever loved, attended upon my person.

After Supper, <hi>Valentine</hi> said unto the King, it is necessary I have a fire all this night in the chamber where my patient is▪ for she will be extream sick all this night. Well, quoth the King, let all things be done, spare for no cost. Now <hi>Valen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine</hi> taketh his way towards the Chamber of fair <hi>Clerimond,</hi> with one who carried wood to make this fire withal, which being done, he willed every one to depart, save only his Squire, then <hi>Valen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

The King of <hi>Brittain</hi> not thinking what would happen strengthened himself with all the Forces he could make and sent out proclamation that all that could bear arms should assist him into <hi>France.</hi> Hereupon Queen <hi>Bertha</hi> with her young Son <hi>Charles</hi> fled to <hi>Lyons</hi> to seek succour: At the same time lived a worthy and trusty Earl of <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy,</hi> who favouring the Queen, and pitying her distress, fortified his Castle against the <hi>Brittains,</hi> to whom the Queen sent 4000 Horse to keep the passage. At last the King of <hi>Brittain</hi> bid the Earl give him passage into <hi>France,</hi> but he answered, No: Hereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on there was appointed a band of souldiers, to lay siege at <hi>Argiers,</hi> but the Earl kept close within the City, and would not issue out thereof. During the siege was King <hi>Pepin</hi> come to <hi>Paris,</hi> &amp; there was joyfully received, when the Queen understood he was at <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris,</hi> she hasted unto him, and when she came before him, in tears, she said: dear Lord, revenge us on this Vsurper. Lady (quoth the King) fear it not. So calling about him his Counsellours, and
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:150341:109"/> men of war, he made haste to furnish up his companies, and many there were that voluntarily offered themselves to do the King a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny service. By this time the King of <hi>Brittain</hi> heard that King <hi>Pepin</hi> was come against him with a great Army, which feared him, and not without cause. But see what followed, for his own friends be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trayed him to K. <hi>Pepin,</hi> only to save their own estates, and make their peace the better with the King. So resolving hereupon, on a night they came to him, lying on his bed, and led him perforce be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore K. <hi>Pepin,</hi> who presently caused his head to be smitten off, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the City of <hi>Paris.</hi> Now they thought that betrayed him, all was well, but the King afterwards seized all their Lands into his own hands.</p>
               <p>Now was <hi>Valentine</hi> much troubled in mind, how he should frée the Emperor his Father from imprisonment, for he knew well, that the Castle was not to be won by War, or Policy, nor by any thing, but by treason, at last he resolved on a subtile plot, and thus it was: He put to Sea 12 ships, manned with 2000 men, and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den with all maner of riches, as precious stones, and silks, and thus as Merchants, arrived they before this strong Castle.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Valentine</hi> took upon him the shape of a Merchant, setting a rich Crown on his head, and said unto his men: Be you all privately armed within the ships, so that none of you be séen, if the Sarazens come aboard, put them to death. Then coming toward the Castle gate, with the Crown on his head, the Porter said: What bring you hither? Friend, said <hi>Valentine,</hi> I am a Merchant, going into <hi>Spain,</hi> and having many rich commodities, I hear say, that I might not pass without a tribute, on pain of death. Said the Porter, I will go to my Lady, and bring you an answer: so he went to <hi>Galazy,</hi> and told his message: the Lady understanding there was such pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Iewels aboard, she said unto her Seneschal: Go and receive the tribute due to me, of the Merchant, and take along with you a sufficient company of Souldiers, lest they should offer you injury. He did as he was commanded, and coming to the Ships, they found inestimable Gems, insomuch as they were ravished there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with; so they taking the value of the tribute due to the Lady, sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly the Christians, that lay hid in the ship, set upon them, &amp; slew them. Then <hi>Valentine</hi> said unto them; Except we go forwards in
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:150341:110"/> this enterprize, we shall never gain the Castle: Wherefore he cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed fifty of his men to put on the Sarazens Gowns over their Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors, and so lading themselves with silks and precious stones, took their way tawards the Castle.</p>
               <p>The Porter tyed up the Lyons, let down the draw-bridge, and thirsting after some great reward, went beyond his bounds, inso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as <hi>Valentine</hi> led him to the Ships, being come, <hi>Valentine</hi> shewed him their dead bodies, and said; I will make you like one of these, if you give me not passage into this Castle. Sir (qd. the Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter) I shall do it: why then (qd. <hi>Valentine</hi>) I will reward thée. Come, said the Porter, and bring all those men whom you have clad in the habit of the Sarazens, for they cannot be known from them in the Castle, and let them enter one by one; which they did: so being en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred, the Porter shewed them a secret postern, which <hi>Valentine</hi> having gotten, caused all the doors to be set open, then winded he his horn, at which all those in the ships hasted unto them. Then he entred the chamber of the Lady <hi>Galazy,</hi> who was astonied there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>at: but he said: Lady, fear not, for I have ventured the Seas, to have a sight of your royal presence: then she bad him welcome, and highly feasted him. <hi>Valentines</hi> men having entred the Castle, with their shouts so affrighted the Lady, that in weeping manner she said unto him: Courteous Knight, save my Virginity. Lady (qd. he) fear not, for there is none that dares attempt any dishonour to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards your person. By this time all the Pagans within the Castle were slain and <hi>Valentine</hi> hasting unto the Dungeon, did break it open, and cryed out aloud: All you that be alive come forth. <hi>Orson</hi> knowing his voice, replyed: Brother, you are welcome, how came you hither? <hi>Valentine</hi> said: I am come to set you at liberty. At these words, the Emperor fell into a swound, but <hi>Orlon</hi> suddenly recovered him: then they came out of the Dungeon, in ragged cloaths, and ill-coloured faces; but the Christians revelled for the space of 7 days in the Castle, and <hi>Orson</hi> falling in love with <hi>Gala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zy,</hi> after the death of <hi>Fezon</hi> married her, by whom he had a Son (na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med <hi>Orsayr</hi>) who after had the Empire at <hi>Constantinople.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>These affairs being thus brought to an end, a counsel was called what was best to be done: at last they resolved to leave a Gari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son to resist the enemy: Some said it was fitting that <hi>Haufray</hi>
                  <pb n="211" facs="tcp:150341:110"/> and <hi>Henry</hi> should undertake this task: but <hi>Haufray</hi> replyed: Not we, for we are determined to go into <hi>France,</hi> to serve our Father. Qd. <hi>Orson,</hi> if you be so resolved, we have small reason to weep for your departure, for there is nothing but treason in you. At these words <hi>Haufray</hi> and <hi>Henry</hi> was displeased, but they durst not shew it. At last it was resolved that the Emperor should take his rest, and his Son <hi>O<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

After this they poysoned the King and Queen. Now little <hi>Charles</hi> was still living; who (as the Gods would have it) hapned under the safe keeping of <hi>Myllon Daugler.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The King and Queen being both thus treacherously poysoned, the two Traitors seemed to be exceeding sorrowful, but D. <hi>Myllon Daugler,</hi> being a man of a valiant and couragious spirit, forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with caused a counsel to be holden, wherein he would have crowned young <hi>Charles</hi> King of <hi>France,</hi> but <hi>Haufray</hi> and <hi>Henry</hi> by bribes so corrupted the Lords, that <hi>Charles</hi> was held too young. Hereupon D. <hi>Myllon</hi> was committed to prison, for standing on the Childs part, and <hi>Charles</hi> held as a Kitchen boy.</p>
               <p>A little after, it hapned that <hi>Haufray</hi> commanded <hi>Charles</hi> to turn a spit, but the boy being full of Majesty, took up the spit, and felled him to the earth. At this, out steps <hi>Henry,</hi> thinking to smite the child, but he being ready to receive him, gave him such a box on the ear, that the blood issued out of his mouth. Then <hi>Haufray</hi> commanded his men to lay hold upon him, but there came a Knight which took <hi>Charles</hi> by the hand, and conve<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

Hereupon D. <hi>Myllon</hi> told his wife thereof who was sister to <hi>Charles.</hi> The Lady could not behold the same for tears, but vowed that they should dearly pay for these treasons and forthwith caused Letters to be written into <hi>Angory,</hi>
                  <pb n="212" facs="tcp:150341:111"/> unto <hi>Valentine,</hi> and the twelve Peers of <hi>France.</hi> These Letters came first into the hands of <hi>Valentine,</hi> who could not chuse but weep at this act of Villany. The Lords perceiving his tears, asked the cause: he answered: K. <hi>Pepin</hi> and the Queen are dead, and as for <hi>Charle<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

At last <hi>Valentine</hi> said: E're to morrow night I will set frée Duke <hi>Myllon,</hi> or else my skill shall deceive me: at which they laughed heartily. <hi>Valentine</hi> departed; and with <hi>Pacolets</hi> horse he suddenly arrived at <hi>Paris,</hi> where by his Art he opened the Gates, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leased all the Prisoners, and being shewed the Chamber where D. <hi>Myllon</hi> was, he entred the same, who being fast asléep, he awak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him, &amp; said: Sir, I am <hi>Valentine,</hi> which am come to set you frée. Then he mounted him on his horse, and bad him not speak, for he was to pass through the air. The Duke prayed him to pass by the Castle of <hi>Angire,</hi> that he might but see his wife, which he did, and being come to the Lady thereof, who presently ran and kissed him, demanding of him whether he went: Lady (qd. he) I go to fight a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the Infidels, to bring home the twelve Peers of <hi>France,</hi> with an Army to overthrow <hi>Haufray</hi> and <hi>Henry,</hi> and to succour <hi>Charles.</hi> Having refreshed themselves with meat, they set forth to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards <hi>Hungary.</hi> Being come, they came before all the barons, who were much astonied at <hi>Valentines</hi> Art, greatly desiring to learn it, but he would teach it no man.

               <p>The Emperor hearing that <hi>Brandiffer</hi> had begirt <hi>Angory,</hi> with so huge an Army, resolved to leave the strong Castle to the guard of a Knight. So the Emperor, <hi>Orson,</hi> and the Gréen Kt. took ship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, accompanied with a 1000 Souldiers: being at Sea, they saw
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:150341:111"/> a great fléet of shipe coming to them, and at last they found it to be a Pagan with 10000 men, going to the succour of <hi>Brand ffer:</hi> the Christians longing to fight with the Pagans, fell upon them, so that there chanced a bloody battel: great valour was shown on both sides, but they knew not whether the victory would incline. At last the Pagan Admiral encountring a Christian Knight, tumbled him over a ship-board: <hi>Orson</hi> standing by him, grew angry, and taking his Ax, struck him stark dead. This deed discouraged the Pagans, that they withdrew themselves, all that night ready to fight, having lost 15 tall ships, and 4000 men. Then the Emperor said: Lords, let us arm our selves with such weapons, as here we have seized from the Pagans; which they presently did, but this en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprize was fatal. For the Emperor was slain by his own Son <hi>Valentine,</hi> who took him for an Infidel as hereafter you shall hear. But here they hoise sail again, and at last arrived in <hi>Angory.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>After a months siege, <hi>Valentine</hi> sent a defiance to <hi>Brandiffer,</hi> offering him battel.

               <p>At this present the Christians got the better, and caused the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidels to give round, but there came in a Sarazen Captain, with 30000 men, and continued the battel more hotter then before. By this time K. <hi>Lucar</hi> lighted on the <hi>Indian</hi> King, and lent him succor.
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:150341:112"/> Now the Christians began to retire insomuch that they had been forced to a shameful flight, had not two valiant Knights arrived in <hi>Angory,</hi> with 700 men at arms (the which lately had come from the holy Sepulchre, and suffered much misery) entred the field. The one of them brought into <hi>France</hi> the daughter of a rich Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miral, called <hi>Claridine,</hi> and caused her to be baptized: the name of the one was <hi>Reynard</hi> of <hi>Province,</hi> the other <hi>Myllon</hi> of <hi>Dyon.</hi> At their approach the Pagans were much discomfited, for <hi>Myllon</hi> of <hi>Dyon</hi> at his first encounter smote K. <hi>Lucar</hi> stark dead, &amp; at the next, another K. called <hi>Rubres,</hi> which accident much amazed <hi>Brandif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer.</hi> At another part of the battel rushed in <hi>Reynard,</hi> and slew many of them. <hi>Valentine</hi> wondred at these two Knights of Chivalry, and coming towards them, said: Lords, you are welcome, I pray you what are you, or by what chance came you hither? Friend (qd. <hi>Rey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nard</hi>) we are Lords of <hi>France,</hi> and lately come from the holy Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulchre, who hearing of these wars, we thought it requisite to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend you against the Pagans.

All this while the <hi>Indian</hi> King had a spleen at <hi>Valentine,</hi> for his last disgrace, &amp; finding him out, accompanied only with thrée other Kings, they so encountred <hi>Valentine,</hi> that they did smite him and his horse to the ground. Being down, he quickly recovered, and drawing out his sword, defended himself therewith, but with much danger. At last D. <hi>Myllon, Sampson,</hi> and <hi>Gravis,</hi> came unto his succour, getting a fresh horse for him. <hi>Valentine</hi> being mount<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, made his course against the <hi>Indian</hi> K. again, and striking him down, took from him his shield, which he kept (for he had lost his own.) This ended, Tydings came that a great Fléet of Sarazens was coming near unto the Haven. Hereupon <hi>Valentine</hi> said: Lords, let us presently go strengthen the passages: so <hi>Valentine</hi> and the D. <hi>Myllon</hi> of <hi>Dyon</hi> went to the Haven, but these were all friends and Christians, amongst whom was his father the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror of <hi>Greece,</hi> of whom you shall hear more at large.</p>
               <p>The Emperor having landed his men, <hi>Valentine</hi> saluted him with his spear in his rest. The Emperor (who bare the shield of a

His Father being dead, he said; <hi>montioy vive Greece.

When he heard him say so, he fell in an extasie from his horse. To this lamentation of the two Brothers, came <hi>Reynard</hi> of <hi>Province,</hi> and <hi>Myllon</hi> of <hi>Dyon</hi> to comfort them, saying: Knight have pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, for tears cannot recal him: Alas, said <hi>Valentine,</hi> what have I done! It were happy for me, if death would take me from this world; I have committed this fact, detestable both to God and men: O what will become of me? my life have I passed away in troubles, torments, and cares, and now to add more sorrow to my days, I have shed the blood of my dear Father. Brother <hi>Orson,</hi> take my sword and cut off my head, that the earth may not bear so bloody a Butcher. Brother, said <hi>Orsod,</hi> depart not thus, but repent, and no doubt but you shall be forgiven. So comforting him in this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, at last they got him to his horse, whereon being mounted, he ran throughout the Pagan troops so furiously, that all they that stood in his way perished. Now began the battel to encrease, and King <hi>Christopher</hi> slew the Christians on every side. At last <hi>V<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

In this battel the Duke <hi>Myllon</hi> of <hi>Dyon▪</hi> and <hi>Reynard</hi> of <hi>Province,</hi> rushed so fierce into the battel of the enemy, that they were taken Prisoners, yet notwithstanding their adverse fortunes, they got their liverties once again, and made <hi>Charles</hi> King of <hi>France,</hi> with honour and joy, to the destruction of <hi>Haufray</hi> and <hi>Henry,</hi> the two notable traitors: yet was not this fierce, long, &amp; tedious battel ended, for they stood it out manfully on either side. <hi>Valentine</hi> being careless of life, at last met with <hi>Brandiffer,</hi> who encountred each other so fiercely, that both fell to the earth, but <hi>Valentine</hi> suddenly recovered himself, took the K. such a blow that he clave his head: K. <hi>Brumant</hi> seeing his Brother slain, departed out of the field, with the Admiral of <hi>Cordes,</hi> and K. <hi>Josueh,</hi> who caused a retreat to be sounded: the Christians following, slew many thousands, and others leapt into the sea, and drowned themselves. So the night drawing on, the Christians returned into the City,

               <p>The Pagans being thus twice put to the worse before <hi>Angory,</hi> D. <hi>Myllon</hi> took his leave of <hi>Valentine</hi> to return into <hi>France,</hi> say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: <hi>Valentine,</hi> I would I could return as swiftly back as you brought me hither?

               <p>At last it was agreed on, that they should joyntly Govern, but <hi>Valentine</hi> continued not long in that state of dignity: for shortly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, on a morning he called to him <hi>Clerimond,</hi> and said thus unto her: Vnderstand me, you know that I have slain my Father, and my conscience remaineth still troubled for the fact, and I am therefore minded to go on Pilgrimage.

Hereat the Lady swounded, and recovering her self, she said: Why hath my Love hidden his intent from me: but all her sorrow could not call him home again.

Now (as the story saith) the Lady <hi>Fezon</hi> hearing that <hi>Orson</hi> had got another Lady with Child, she dyed with grief. Being dead, <hi>Orson</hi> made a years solemnity of her Fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, and after married <hi>Galazy,</hi> of whom you have heard before.</p>
               <p>Now I shall shew you how <hi>Valentine</hi> came back to <hi>Constanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nople</hi> in beggerly wéeds, insomuch that he was not known, going from house to house a begging. At last he went into his Brothers Palace about supper time, and those that waited on the table beat him away: <hi>Orson</hi> seeing them so churlish, had them let him alone, for I am willing that all poor men should be received, for my Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Valentines</hi> sake, that so we may hear tydings of him. After this they brought him meat and wine, but he espying a basket wherein the scraps were put, eat thereof which amazed the beholders. Night being come, the servitors asked <hi>Orson</hi> if he would let that coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeit bide in his Palace. I (qd. <hi>Orson</hi>) for it may be for some
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:150341:114"/> vow which he hath made. Thus abode <hi>Valentine,</hi> and made his bed under the stairs, of straw. On the morrow, <hi>Orson</hi> passing by, gave him money, after came his mother, and his Wife <hi>Clerimond,</hi> and they gave him money, saying: How can you endure thus naked, without cloaths? this night you shall have some provided for you. They being gone, he gave his money to two poor men standing by him who scoffed him for his labour: next day ar dinner, they gave him variety of meats, which he refused, and made signs for the Alms-basket: <hi>Orson,</hi> to try him yet further, caused some of the best meat to be put therein, but he would not touch it. Then said <hi>Orson:</hi> Surely this is some vow that he hath made unto the Gods. Thus <hi>Valentine</hi> thus remained within the Palace without being known that all men thought him dead.</p>
               <p>In these days there was a King of <hi>Hungaria,</hi> named <hi>Hugon,</hi> who heard that <hi>Valentine</hi> had given over the Empire of <hi>Greece,</hi> unto his Brother <hi>Orson.</hi> This <hi>Hugon</hi> came to <hi>Constantinople,</hi> and was honourably received. After his arrival he came to y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> Lady <hi>Clerimond,</hi> and said: I am King of <hi>Hungaria,</hi> and have no wife, and for that purpose I am come hither to crave your love, I know that <hi>Valentine</hi> is dead, or else that he will never return; wherefore Lady grant me thy love, and thou shalt be Queen of <hi>Hungaria.</hi> Sir, qd. the Lady, I thank you for your Kingly proffer, but to be your wife, I cannot, for sure my <hi>Valentine</hi> liveth, and for seven years I will every day expect his return; besides, when I make choice of a hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, my brother <hi>Orson</hi> and the Green Kt. must know, for without their leave I will never marry. Then he went towards <hi>Orson,</hi> and demanded of him, if he heard any tydings of his Brother. Great K. (qd. <hi>Orson</hi>) no, I heard that he left me a Letter, the which his wife delivered me, and certified me that he is gone to exile, and beareth about him half the Ring that he was married withal, the other half he left with her, charging her that she believe nothing of him, till she see the other half which he possessed. The Gods be his good spéed, qd. <hi>Hugon,</hi> for he was a worthy Knight: But one thing qd. <hi>Hugon,</hi> have I more to acquaint you with, I am determined to take a journey to <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> to visit the holy Shrine, so you would bear me company. With all my heart (qd. <hi>Orson</hi>) but let us go to <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gory,</hi> and take with us the Green Kt. who is K. thereof: it shall be

Some four days after, King <hi>Hugon</hi> came to <hi>Constantinople,</hi> and was received with great ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, but <hi>Clerimond</hi> shewed him no good entertainment. Being there, he said unto the Empress: You understand of the death of your Son, for whom I am sorry: but it is agreed upon, that I shall marry the Lady. Sir, (qd. <hi>Clerimond</hi>) I am not willing to marry you, nor any other: All this treason <hi>Valentine</hi> heard. But in the end, the matter was so urged, that <hi>Hugon</hi> had the Lady, which much encreased his joys, but they were short.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Valentine</hi> having ended his Orisons to the Gods, the Oracle made answer to him on this manner: <hi>V<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

Pilgrim (quoth the Lady) advise well thy self what thou speakest, for I heard my Love is dead. Lady (qd. the Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grim) believe it not, for I protest to deliver my body to death, if it be not true as I have said: <hi>Hugon</hi> hearing these words related to the Ladies, secretly mounted his horse, and never returned back. The Ladies on the other side, were much amazed at the Pilgrims tale, and offered to feast him, but he would not, only he said to them, Ladies; pardon me, I pray, for I have certain companions in the Town, which I must needs visit, therefore I request your pardon: yet <hi>Clerimond</hi> would gratifie him for his news giving him money

               <head>CHAP. LII. How at the end of seven years, Valentine dyed in the Palace of Constantinople: and how Orson turned Hermet.</head>
               <p>AT the end of seven years, <hi>Valentine</hi> fell into a mortal disease, whereof he dyed. Before his death an Angel appeared to him, saying: <hi>Valentine,</hi> thy glass is run, for within four hours thou shalt dye: whereat he greatly rejoyced, making signs for pen, ink, and paper; when he had it, he wrote that it was himself that appeared like a Pilgrim, and discovered the treason. After putting to it his Name, he closed up the paper, putting in the other half of the King that he had kept; shortly after he laid him down and dyed.</p>
               <p>When <hi>Orson</hi> saw that he was dead, he was troubled in mind. The poor man being dead, held a letter in his hand, which <hi>Orson</hi> would have taken out, but could not: then came <hi>Clerimond,</hi> and as soon as she laid hold thereon, the hand opened it self. <hi>Clerimond</hi> breaking up the Letter, and knowing the half King, said: Lords, we shall shortly hear news of <hi>Valentine:</hi> So a Secretary was cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to read it: at the reading hereof, great lamentation on each
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:150341:117"/> side, but especially of <hi>Clerimond,</hi> who falling upon the dead body, said: Alas, I have lost all my joy, comfort and hopes: for that my Love should die so near my person, and I know not of it. Now great preparation were made for his Funeral Rites, he was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terred in great magnificence in <hi>Constantinople. Clerimond</hi> after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward betook her to a single life. Thus having shown the death of <hi>Valentine,</hi> and what became of <hi>Clerimond;</hi> Let us return to <hi>Orson</hi> who ruled the Empire of <hi>Constantinople</hi> seven years, and by his second Wife <hi>Galazy,</hi> he had a Son named <hi>Mo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

               </p>
               <p>After 7 years were expired <hi>Galazy</hi> dyed, for whom the Emperor <hi>Orson</hi> was exceediag sorrowful, and in the end betook him to the Woods, where as he fed on Bread and Roots, and such as he found. It happened one night that he saw a Vision, it seemed to him more glorious then his tongue could utter. After this Vision he awaked, and being astonied hereat, with tears he came to the Gréen Knight, and said: Sir I sée the uncertainty of the world for which I am willing to resign my estate and Children unto you: sée them well educated, that they may by you be made fit to govern such a people, for I will spend the rest of my days in solitary contemplation. When the Gréen Knight had heard these words, he wept bitterly, but <hi>Orson</hi> recomforted him, saying: Wéep not, but pray for me, as I for you, that you may accomplish that which I put you in trust withal. With this <hi>Orson</hi> departed, chargeing the Green Knight not to tell it to any. So taking his way towards a Wood, he there spent the remainer of his days. The Green Kt. after so governed his children that they carefully spent their time on earth, and followed their Father to his Grave.</p>
